# RULES

1. Use a question to name every file. This will enable me to supercharge Anki.
2. Use questions to name every subsection of every file.
3. ALWAYS use spaces in the tags. Also try not to have too many YAML categories. Keep them all as tags. If needed use subtags eg projects/TWOTB ... but even that might not be necessary.
4. Only have two folders in Documents. My Own Creative Works and Library. Full Stop.  And maybe Admin. And that's it. Use tags to create folders as I need on the fly. The idea is to maximize visibility and not go looking on the Internet when I have my own internet here that I just don't know how to effectively search. The main value add that others out there on the Internet provide is that they've tagged stuff, and I haven't tagged my own stuff yet.
5. All Literature Notes must go into the Library folder.

All permanent notes will be in the posts folder and will be published depending on how they are named. If named with a date etc then they will get automatically published.

SOME INSTRUCTIONS

- List all the notes with the same tag using the Dataview query.
- Then after that, read them and look for an idea that stands out.
