#Authenticity, The #Gift-Call & Natural Affection

Authenticity, The Gift-Call & Natural Affection
 
God has given me a number of #gifts, arranged in an irrepeatable configuration, and calls me to transmit these gifts to others. In a sense, I am the gifts...they (Him) called me into being, and being an end in themselves, only find fulfillment when they themselves are given to other people around me. In other words, by sharing the gifts Through which Gid called me into existence, in all their eclectic splendor, with others, I am giving myself to them, and thus finding amd achieving the highest fulfillment I can achieve here on earth. This is true charity and love for others....giving the,mother gifts that God has given me.
 
What are these calls?
 
1. To faith.
2. To the Work.
3. To celibacy.
4. To create verbal pictures.
5. To be a brother and a son.
6. To spread laughter and light-heartedness.
 
7. Guiding people along the concrete and tangible paths I have explored of abstract, spiritual truths (authenticity is taking people down paths I myself have already gone down, because otherwise I am a false guide.)
 
Looking at the above I realize that every call from God is an invitation to join Him in a way that He already is. They are all foretastes of Heaven, all graces, all the reason why He created me. To be, inside of Him.
 
"For God's gifts and his call are irrevocable." Romans 11:29.
 
I think that God's gifts and his call could be a safe place to base at least a part of my self-esteem. Love of self is loving Gods will for me...Firstly because they come from outside of myself, and come from God. Secondly, because they never go away. Thirdly, because they are at the level of being first and foremost. The doing is merely a far and away expression of these gifts and the call. And when properly ordered, they stem from charity-presence-attention-giftgiving, not from greed-fear. Just like a baby. The only performance and doing they have is to eat, sleep and poop. And yet, they share their gift-call to innocent beautiful life, and they make the people around them very happy, just by being themselves, just by being babies.
 
Being a baby, being a child, means to be...a very natural, unfettered, un fearful, unanxious, and un-agenda-ed expression of the gift-call from God. For me, responding to the above 7 calls, is me BEING a baby.
 
From Interior Freedom...
 
Identification of the self with the good one is able to accomplish leads to spiritual pride: consciously or not, we consider ourselves the source of that good, instead of recognizing that all the good we are able to do is a free gift from God. “What have you that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?”3 This pride leads us to pass judgment on those who do not accomplish as much as we do, to be impatient with those who prevent us from carrying out a given project, and so forth.
 
#Pride, #hardheartedness, contempt for neighbor, along with #fear and discouragement are the inevitable results of confusing my self with my talents. Failures are unendurable, because instead of being seen as normal, even beneficial, they are perceived as an attack on our being.
 
Human beings are more than the sum of the good they can accomplish. They are children of God, whether they do good or cannot yet manage to do anything. Our Father in heaven does not love us because of the good we do. He loves us for ourselves, because he has adopted us as his children forever.4
 
This is why humility, spiritual poverty, is so precious: it locates our identity securely in the one place where it will be safe from all harm. If our treasure is in God, no one can take it from us. Humility is truth. I am what I am in God’s eyes: a poor child who possesses absolutely nothing, who receives everything, infinitely loved and totally free. I have received everything in advance from the freely bestowed love of my Father, who said to me definitively: “All that is mine is yours.”5
 
Our treasure is not the kind that moths or worms can devour.6 It is in heaven in God’s hands. It depends on God alone, his good will and unfailing goodness to us. Our identity has its source in the creative love of God, who made us in his own image and destines us to live with him forever.
 
Love is what remains when nothing remains. We all carry within us this memory when, beyond our failures, our separations, the words we survived, there arises from the depths of the night, like a song that is barely audible, the assurance that beyond the disasters in our lives, even beyond joy, suffering, birth, death, there exists a space where nothing threatens, that nothing has ever threatened and that runs no risk of destruction, an intact space, that of the love that was the foundation of our being.7
 
This does not mean it doesn’t matter whether we behave well or badly. We should do good and avoid evil as far as we can, because sin hurts God, harms us, and harms other people, and the damage it causes is often difficult to put right. But we have no right to identify people with the wrong they do. That would be to imprison them and lose all hope in their regard. Nor can we identify anyone—especially not ourselves—with the good they do.
