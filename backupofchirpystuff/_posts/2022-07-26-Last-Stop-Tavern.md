Last Stop Tavern
=============


Tavern located in Obari, just before the desert.

The drinks are cheap but watered down with melon juice and you're likely to get your pocket picked.

A mudbrick building with bright symbols painted on the walls. No one knows exactly what they mean but the owner claims they are spells to keep danger out.
 
Slightly manky inside, the floors and tables are always a little sticky, the air is filled with smoke and the raucous laughter of cattle rustlers, who are the primary customers.
