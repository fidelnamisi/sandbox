THE RATIONALE FOR THE DANGERZONE ARTICLES

Q: Why am I pursuing this line of reasoning? Why am I carving out the time and making the effort to do this,instead of my usual 9-5 job?

A: For the following reasons:

1. To have greater #perspective, so I can broaden my own thinking via analyzing various topics, avoid marrow-mindedness of thought but rather learn to embrace varied views and opinions.

I wish to challenge my own #thinking and to be the change I wish to see in the world. A lot of the angst in the
world is due to people refusing to see things from the
perspective of others, leading to partisanship and #polarization;
and the end of thinking Whilst I cannot change other people, and must learn to accept them as they are, what I can do is to change myself, and this is what these analyses attempt to do: challenge my own thinking and positions on
varrous views, and make me a less polarized and polarizing human being.



#3. To keep my mind youthful by #exploring, #learning, exercising and challenging it.

What I usually find as I analyze topics and go deep into them, is it brings back to my memory various things I have heard and read, which I would otherwise never remember. This in turn helps me to see the
vaker of reading widely and having deep conversations with people. Also, in an a posteriori sort of wace, it helps
me to see what books are worth reading and what sort of conversations are profitable, by assessing the
impact that they have on any subsequent thinking.

#4. To experience the sheer joy of #thinking, which is often purchased at the exacting toll of effort.

I never feel inclined to write anything before I sit down
and begin, but once I do and if I go all in, enthusiason and energy follow the outflow of effort. This enthusiason and energy allows me to play with ideas, explore, discover and learn. The words I use and the ideas they express become like the toys I used to play with as a child. They keep my mind in a growth-state,just like a child's.
