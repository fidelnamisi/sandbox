<!---Saturday 8th August 2022--->
Children have this incredible drive to get at the first principles of things.

"Eat your veggies."
<br>
"Why?"
<br>
"Brush your teeth."
<br>
"Why?"
<br>
"Go to sleep."
<br>
"Why?"
<br>
"Because I said so!"

This shows that humans are born with a natural ability to philosophize, which, for most people, atrophies with time.
