<!---Sunday 14 August 2022--->


This #digitalgarden is for me. I am tired of having all my stuff scattered in so many different places on my computer. I'd rather have them all in the same place. 

What's here is what might also be useful for someone else in some way. In this way, when I die, whatever little value it may have may not be entirely lost. 
Now the only thing I'm leaving out of this are my private journals. Firstly because they are private and secondly because they aren't really of any use to anyone else. They are useful to me insofar as they are like the word spoken into the void at the dawn of time, bringing order to the chaos.
"In the beginning the world was as yet formless and void"... until a word was spoken... this is why I journal. It's like [[my personal creation story]].
