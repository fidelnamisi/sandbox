Description: Building or Landmark. Wonders, natural and built, ruins, dungeons, temples, great trees, Smithy, Inn, Castle. Anything that you can point to and people consider significant enough to name.

---

A prison in the middle of the desert that the clerics build to imprison all practitioners of magic (aka sorcerers)

People say that once you go in there, you never come out again and you'll be tortured to death.

A labyrinthine underground dungeon built beneath the Andani caves.

Dark, hot, uninviting, lit by flaming torches and inhabited by bats. The walls are bare, hard rocks and the floor of the cave is littered with the broken shells of bats and shells from the giant tortoises that had occupied the floor.>)
