A cleric from the Salo religion who has made it her personal mission to hunt down the Wa'azi.

People say she's a fanatic who's as likely to kill a friend as a foe. They also say she bathes in milk to keep herself young.

She's beautiful, a trait she uses against her enemies. She has long dreadlocks and flawless skin.

She loathes magic and specifically the Wa'azi because of the Prime Summoning, which she believes has opened the doors to chaos on her beloved island. She vows to find and destroy them all.
