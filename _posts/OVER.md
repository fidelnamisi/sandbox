The wait will soon be over.
The pain will soon be over. 
The weight will soon be over.
The bog will soon be be over.
The rain will soon be over.
The wet will soon be over.
Pangs will soon be over.
The cold will soon be over.
The climb will soon be over.
The night will soon be over.
The journey, soon over.
And I will be back home.
Again.
To start all over.
