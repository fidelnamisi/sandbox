Peacefulness,  
A sea of calmness  
Washing waves of placid beauty,  
Of silence,  
Over a mind,  
In need of cleansing.

  

A beauty  
Beyond words,  
Is found in that stillness,  
That impresses itself,  
Onto a mind  
In need of such moulding.

Barrenness,  
A fruitful desert,  
Whose limits  
Give meaning,  
To a mind,  
That needs defining.

Waiting,  
Like a persuading friend,  
Inviting the discovery,  
Of a hidden realm,  
Locked away,  
In a mind,  
In need of inspiring.

The unbinding emptiness,  
The calming excitement,  
Knows what it wants to tell me.  
I listen in silence.
