## Caiphas and Elsie have a romantic dinner

**Synopsis**  


**Text**  
Elsie, Stan and Gugu were the last ones left in the office that evening. Chichi and Caiphas had already left.
"Hey, Elsie. Can I ask you something?" Caiphas stepped into the open plan office, a look of concern written all over his face. 
"Yes, sure," Elsie replied, getting to her feet. "What is it?" 
"I'll have to show it to you," he answered, "in the restaurant."
"Okay," Elsie said and followed him out. Stan looked at Gugu and Gugu just shrugged.
"I don't like that guy, man," Stan said, after Elsie and Caiphas were out of earshot. "Something about him gives me the creeps."
"Probably it's the fact that he's putting the moves on your ex, has a lot of money, is successful, and is better looking that you are. You want me to continue?"
"It's not jealousy."
"Sounds that way to me."
"Why does he want to see Elsie all of a sudden so urgently. Why not you or me?"
"Ask him that when he comes back," Gugu said, shutting down his laptop and getting up. "I'm going home. Are you coming?"
"Yeah, yeah," Stan replied. "In a minute." 

Elsie followed Caiphas down the passage. "What's happening? Is everything alright?"
"Yes, everything's fine," Caiphas said, as they walked past the reception and into the restaurant.
It was completely empty, and the lights had been turned off. The soft, gentle rays of the evening sun shone through the windows, illuminating the space with the golden glow of the evening. On a table in the middle of the restaurant, two candles burnt bright on a silver candle-holder next to a bottle of wine, some wine glasses, and two places set for dinner.
"Surprise!" Caiphas said, spinning around and beaming at Elsie. Elsie clapped her hands to her mouth.
"What's this?" she finally managed to say.
"I'm just keeping my end of the bargain," Caiphas replied. "I hope you'll be able to have dinner with me tonight."
Elsie shook her head in disbelief. "What?" Caiphas asked. "You can't do it?"
"Of course I can, Caiphas" she replied, bouncing on the balls of her heels in excitement. "But this is --- er --- romantic." She noticed for the first time the soft jazz music that was playing on the overhead stereo. "I thought we would just go out for a simple lunch or something sometime this week when it suits us."
"Are you busy this evening?" Caiphas was careful to inject a subtle note of disappointment in his voice.
"Of course not!" Elsie replied quickly. She just hadn't been expecting all of this, and didn't quite know how to react. "Dinner's fine. I didn't have any plans this evening," she added, giggling. "Except to make sure my siblings finish their homework."
"That's why I set it up for now," Caiphas said, glancing at his watch. "It's six. And I'm guessing I could get you back home by around --- er--- eight? Would that be fine?"
Elsie felt ashamed of herself. "That would be fantastic. Thanks Caiphas. But - hold on. There's something you're forgetting."
"What's that."
"It was part of our deal," she said, playfully poking her finger into his chest, "You were meant to take us to a place that you didn't own."
"Ah, just one minute," Caiphas responded, raising his hands defensively. "Have you ever been to the kitchen?"
"No," Elsie shook his head.
"Then I'm breaking all the rules, but there's something that I think you should see."
He took her arm and led her past the tables, the buffet island and around the till. He pushed open the swinging doors and held them open for Elsie to walk through.
"Behold," he said, with a flourish, "My cooking efforts."
There were a couple of pots on one of the stoves, as well as a casserole dish in the oven.
"What?" Elsie said, clapping her hands to her mouth for the second time that evening. "You cook?"
"I'm not the best in the world," Caiphas replied, leading her into the kitchen. "But I wanted to keep my promise while surprising you at the same time. So I thought I'd give cooking a bash. I hope that this makes up for not taking you out?"
Elsie just smiled.

A few minutes later, they were seated having the first course of Caiphas's meal.
"This calamari is delicious," Elsie said, stuffing another piece into her mouth. "Where did you learn how to cook like this?"
"The internet," Caiphas replied, smiling, as he poured her some white wine.
"No, please," Elsie replied. 
"Why? You're not driving, are you?"
"No, but it just feels weird, coz I'm at work and stuff."
"Oh come on. It's after hours, and you're technically not at work, because everyone's knocked off."
Elsie smiled. "Yeah, okay, I guess you're right," she said. "Cheers."
"Cheers," Caiphas replied, and they clinked glasses.

Two hours and several glasses of wine later, Elsie was stuffed full and couldn't take any more pampering from Caiphas. She looked at her watch and gasped.
"Oh my God!"
"What's wrong?"  Caiphas asked.
"Look at the time." 
"It's nine o'clock."
"I was meant to be home by eight." She took her bag out and rummaged thought it for her phone, pulled it out and started typing a quick message. Caiphas looked at her lazily.
"Any emergencies at home?" he asked.
"No, but I just want them to know that I'm okay."
"Did they try and message you or call you?"
"No," Elsie replied as she typed away on her phone.
"I think you worry too much about them," Caiphas said, taking another sip of his wine. "At least you worry more about them than they do about you."
"I guess you're right," Elsie replied, hitting the send button. She rose to her feet, swayed a little bit, and collapsed on her chair again.
"Whoa---" she said. "That wine got to my head." Caiphas laughed.
"Here, have some water," he said, pouring some water into a glass. "But don't stress much. You're going straight home young lady. I'm going to drop you off at the gate."
"But what about all of this mess?" she asked, looking at all the plates, dishes and glasses surrounding them.
"You're so domestic," Caiphas replied. "That's one of the things I love about you."
Elsie choked on the glass of water she was sipping. Had he just said the "L" word to her. She forced the water down and tried to calm down and just breathe.
"Don't worry about the plates and stuff. The staff's going to clean it up in the morning. Let's just get you home. Are you okay to stand now?"
"Yes, yes I am," she said, rising to her feet slowly and feeling a little bit ashamed of herself for not being able to handle her drink more manfully. "I just needed to get used to it, that's all." 
"Let's go," Caiphas said, blowing out the candles and pulling Elsie's chair back for her.
"I still need to lock up and set the alarms and stuff."
"Okay," Caiphas said, turning off the lights and locking the doors of the restaurant behind him. They went through the entire museum, locking the doors. They eventually got to the alarm key pad, that was tucked away in a corner of the reception area.
"Leave the alarm," Caiphas said, nonchalantly. "Nothing's going to happen. Let's just go."
Elsie wavered, glancing at the alarm keypad and at Caiphas, standing at the sliding doors and keeping them open by standing between the sensors.
"It will just take one minute."
"You said you're late, and you yourself nothing's ever happened in this museum. Come on, let's go," he said, turning and walking towards the car. Elsie took one last look at the green lights that illuminated the keypad, shrugged, turned and hurried out the door.

As they drove out the gates, Bongani the security guard gave them a dirty look, and then went back to his guard house.
"What's wrong with him?" Caiphas asked, as they turned into the main road.
"He was proabably asleep, and hated the fact that we woke him up." Caiphas laughed, then went silent.
"Thanks for tonight. I really enjoyed myself."
"No, thank you. You did all the cooking."
"I enjoy cooking."
"That means you'll make a good husband someday," Elsie replied. "So you're telling me that there's no special somebody in your life."
"No, there isn't," Caiphas replied. "At least not at the moment, or," he added meaningfully, "not yet." Elsie rolled the window down and sucked in a breath of the cool, night air. This was getting too intense for her. What about Stan? She didn't know why his name had popped into her head at that precise moment.
"And yourself?" he asked. "No special someone."
"No, not at the moment," she replied. Then after a moment's thought, added, "Not yet."
Caiphas turned around and beamed at her.

A few minutes later, he pulled to a halt outside her house.
"Goodnight, then. I'll see you tomorrow."
"Thanks again for a beautiful evening, Caiphas." 
"Let me walk you to your door."
"No, I'll be fine."
"I insist," he said, unbuckling his seatbelt, and turning off the engine. "You can't prevent me from being a gentleman."
Elsie rolled her eyes and got out the car. They covered the few metres to her door in seconds. 
"Okay then," he said.
"Okay." She said. Neither of them moved. Elsie stood there waiting, not sure what to do, knowing what the right move was but knowing also that it wasn't hers to make. Then she saw him leaning in closer, and she felt her heart beating faster within her. She could smell his cologne, feel his breathe on her lips, and the next thing she knew, she was locked in a passionate kiss with him.  After what seemed like a sun-filled eternity on that chilly winter night, he drew away from her, and just stared into her eyes.
"Okay, then."
"Okay," she replied. He smiled, and turned and walked away towards his car, glancing over his shoulder as he went, as if he couldn't get enough of her. She just stood there, grinning like an idiot.
He got into the car, turned on the engine, reversed, flashed the headlights twice at her by way of farewell, and drove slowly up the street.
Elsie cupped her face in her hands for the third time that evening, feeling flustered, excited and confused all at the same time. She couldn't believe all of this was happening to her. As she opened the door and stepped into the messy living room, Stan's face once again flashed across her mind. Her elated mood instantly changed, and she slammed the door shut behind her.
