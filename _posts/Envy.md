The next time you find yourself envying someone who seems more successful than you are, consider this.

When people worship you, and elevate you to God-status, they rip you away from your humanity, from your connectedness to the rest of mankind, from being able to make the sincere and equalizing gift of self through which you find fulfillment as a human person. The deeply rooted desire for the infinite is a desire to be with God.Â This is far better than beingÂ _like_God. Both are good, but the former is a far better good. It is far better to beÂ _with_the infinite, than to merely beÂ _like_the infinite. But because we cannot be God, we try to beÂ _like_God, and thus lose the chance to beÂ _with_God.
