“A SECOND CHANCE”

WRITTEN BY

Fidel Namisi


SUMMARY

Sentenced to community service at a church for pirating their own CDs, Tooth and Nails start a gospel singing group to avoid manual labour. Tooth incurs the opposition of Pastor Titus who is the champion of physical discipline to correct one’s wrongs. His daughter Lindi, who is also Tooth’s ex-girlfriend, is caught between making the men in her life happy and discovering her own voice. Meanwhile Nails’ voice is drowned out by Tooth despite him having the key to making the group work.

                                         ACT ONE

                                                               FADE IN:



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM - DAY

               A TRIO SINGS a moving PRAISE AND WORSHIP HYMN on the stage.
               The suave, good-looking LUNGI (24), resplendent in the latest
               skhothane wear sings tenor. TARYN (23), an attractive colored
               girl sings soprano and the bespectacled, suspender-wearing
               nerd SAM(22), harmonizes with a baritone. Across from them
               sit the tall and stately PASTOR JEFF (late forties) and the
               neatly dressed, prim and proper PASTOR TITUS (mid forties). 

               Peeking in at the back is LINDI (21). Beautiful, demure.
               Longing in her eyes. Wishing she were on stage too.

               The TRIO sounds great - - for a beat, then--

                                   LUNGI 
                         Taryn. Girl. You're off pitch
                         again.

                                   TARYN
                         What? I've told you Lungi, you need
                         to get your ears checked.

                                   LUNGI
                         You're supposed to be here...

               He DEMONSTRATES, humming.

                                   TARYN
                         You're tone deaf. That's exactly
                         what I was singing.

               Jeff shakes his head in disbelief. Titus smirks.

                                   LUNGI
                         Taryn, we all know you have
                         problems taking er.. Direction. But
                         this week I'm in charge so...

                                   TARYN
                         Oh puh-leeze. You can't even hold a
                         note to save your life.

               Lungi splutters. What an insult.

                                   LUNGI
                         What?--What?

               He breaks into a solo. Holds a VERY HIGH NOTE. Until --

                                   JEFF
                         Okay. Enough. Who's in charge here?

                                   TARYN
                         Me.

                                   LUNGI
                         I am.

               Off Jeff's puzzlement.

                                   TARYN
                         We're taking turns.

                                   SAM
                             (excited)
                         It's me next week.

                                   JEFF
                         Is this how you intend to represent
                         us at Nationals? You want to make
                         us the laughing stock of Orlando?

               Tense silence. Jeff TEARS up some printed forms on the chair 
               beside him.

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         You can forget about entering the
                         competition. 

               Titus grins.

                                   TITUS
                         What do you call yourselves again?
                         Wall of Jericho?

               He sniggers. They turn to leave. Titus spots Lindi. She steps
               out of sight. Titus and Jeff exit.

               The TRIO exchange dark looks. 

                                   SAM
                         Okay. Guys. So, for next week. I
                         printed out some rules. 

               He picks up some print outs. Taryn and Lungi stalk out. Out
               on Sam's bewilderment.



               INT. MAGISTRATE'S COURT � DAY

               A BAILIFF stands guard in the courtroom. TOOTH (24), a good
               looking young man in an OTT pantsula get-up, and NAILS (24),
               dread-locked with an honest, worried face, sit beside each
               other. Behind them are AUNT JABU (late fifties), motherly,
               overweight, beaming happiness and the buxom, attractive
               ELMARIE VAN ZYL (late thirties), in a business suit. On the
               adjacent bench is KING PIN (40), a stocky man in a cheap
               suit. The doors are flung open and the elderly MAGISTRATE
               waddles in. 

                                   BAILIFF
                         All rise.

               They comply, resume their seats when the magistrate takes
               his.

                                   MAGISTRATE
                             (reading off his papers)
                         Anasthasius Shonge.

               Tooth stands up. The judge eyes him over his spectacles.

                                   MAGISTRATE (CONT'D)
                         Respond when I call your name. 
                             (beat, reads)
                         Sospeter Ntini.

                                   NAILS
                         Present.

               Nails springs up.

                                   MAGISTRATE
                         You are accused of pirating music
                         CDs. How do you plead?

                                   TOOTH
                         Not guilty.

                                   NAILS
                         Guilty.

               Tooth hushes Nails with a glare.

                                   TOOTH
                         Not guilty Master. Those CDs are
                         ours master. We sold them because
                         the producer refused to pay us on
                         time.

               King Pin shoots to his feet.

                                   KING PIN
                         That's the lie! 
                             (to the Magistrate,
                              pleading)
                         I have to cover costs first.
                         Marketing. Distribution.

                                   TOOTH
                             (sarcastic)
                         A new M3.

               King Pin glares at Tooth. Ignores him.

                                   KING PIN
                             (ignores him)
                         Master I am Christian. I don't tell
                         the lies anymore.

                                   TOOTH
                         I'm also Christian. I've been on a
                         church camp. I don't steal.

               The Magistrate bangs his gavel.

                                   MAGISTRATE
                         Order in the court. 
                             (no time for nonsense)
                         Shonge and Ntini. I find you guilty
                         of the crime of music piracy. 

               AUNT JABU whoops in delight.

                                   AUNT JABU
                         Oh Jehovah! Now they can move out
                         and stop eating my food.

               The Magistrate silences her with a stern look. Tooth and
               Nails are bawled over.

                                   MAGISTRATE
                         However. Due to extenuating
                         circumstances.
                             (beat)
                         Namely the music being your own-
                         your crime constitutes a
                         misdemeanour, not a felony.
                         Standard sentence is fifty hours
                         community service.

               Tooth and Nails give each other high fives, beaming. This is
               going to be easy.

                                   MAGISTRATE (CONT'D)
                         At Olifantsvlei Sewage Treatment
                         works. 

               On Tooth and Nails. Bawled over. Tooth swoons. Nails catches
               him just in time.

               Elmarie stands up.

                                   ELMARIE
                         Your honour, if I may.

               The Magistrate nods.

                                   ELMARIE (CONT'D)
                         Elmarie Van Zyl, Legal Advisor. The
                         workers at the treatment plant feel
                         undermined by the influx of
                         miscreants.
                         But there's a new program in the
                         Correctional Services database
                         which we feel will fit this case
                         perfectly.

               Beat while the Magistrate considers this.

                                   MAGISTRATE
                         Shall we confer in my chambers? 

               Elmarie nods. The Magistrate bangs his gavel.

                                   MAGISTRATE (CONT'D)
                         Court adjurned. Reconvene in thirty
                         minutes. 

               He exits. They all arise.

                                   AUNT JABU
                             (sneering)
                         Christians! Since when? I've never
                         even seen you praying Tooth!

               Tooth closes his eyes, joins his hands in fervent prayer.

                                   TOOTH
                         Dear God. This is not looking good. 
                         Please give me one last chance and
                         I won't screw up. Promise.

               Nails elbows him.

                                   NAILS
                         You can't say that when you pray!

               Tooth looks up at the sky.

                                   TOOTH
                         Sorry God!

               CLOSE ON Nails shaking his head in disbelief.

                                       END ACT ONE

                                         ACT TWO



               INT. PASTOR JEFF'S OFFICE � DAY

               JEFF plunks on his seat, disappointed.

                                   TITUS
                         You take this singing business way
                         too seriously Jeff. Last year it
                         was a camp. Now it's a contest.

               Jeff looks up, meets Titus's gaze.

                                   JEFF
                         It's not just a contest Titus. It's
                         the -
                             (with emphasis)
                         National Praise and Worship
                         Competition.

                                   TITUS
                         The youth have enough music on
                         Sundays and Wednesdays already.
                         Plus we've got the new Friday
                         service coming. What else do you
                         want?

               Jeff thinks about it for a beat.

                                   JEFF
                         When was the last time we had even
                         ten people showing up for the youth
                         service? 

               Titus is silent. He can't answer that one and Jeff knows it.

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         Back in my day -- when we used to
                         win the nationals-- the hall was
                         packed. Every Wednesday.

                                   TITUS
                         That church in Dobsonville was
                         smaller. You said so yourself.

               Jeff averts his gaze. Titus presses on--

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         I've got nothing against singing
                         Jeff. But when it gets competitive, 
                         it becomes about shining. And big
                         egos. And winning competitions and
                         being famous. They will forget God.

                                   JEFF
                             (getting heated)
                         If young people use their God-given
                         talents for the best, then that's
                         giving glory to God, Titus.

                                   TITUS
                             (mirrors the heat)
                         You can't turn a house of worship
                         into a concert hall.

               Jeff is stung by that come-back. He stands up.

                                   JEFF
                         Nor can you turn it into a hard
                         labour camp. You've practically
                         chased away all the young people
                         with your clean up sessions and
                         gardening days.

               Titus regards Jeff for a beat.

                                   TITUS
                         Then we differ theologically.

                                   JEFF
                         This is not theological, man.
                         You've made this personal. 
                             (beat, silent)
                         You can't treat all the youth as
                         you do your own child.

                                   TITUS
                             (mind your own business)
                         This has nothing to do with Lindi.
                             (heavily ironic)
                         Thank God she wants to be a
                         deaconness. At least she's got her
                         priorities straight.

               He turns around to leave. Out on Jeff, the irony not lost on
               him.



               INT. CHURCH CORRIDOR � DAY

               TITUS walks out onto the corridor, bumps into LINDI and TARYN
               lugging BOXES. 

                                   TITUS
                         You didn't come home last night,
                         Lindi.

               Lindi's flummoxed for a second. Wheels in her head turning
               quickly.

                                   LINDI
                         I--told you --I was doing an
                         assignment at Taryn's, Pa. We ran a
                         bit late and there were no taxis. I
                         slept over. I tried calling but--

               She trails off as Titus levels his interrogator's stare at
               Taryn. Taryn hastily nods, corroborating.

                                   TARYN
                         Sorry Moruti.

                                   TITUS
                             (to Lindi)
                         You know the curfew Lindi.

                                   LINDI
                         But I had to do this assignment Pa.
                         I'm--

                                   TITUS
                         As long as your under my roof, you
                         play by my rules. Clear?

               Lindi nods, submissive. Titus glances at Taryn, storms off.
               Once he's out of earshot--

                                   LINDI
                             (relieved)
                         Thank you, thank you, thank you!

                                   TARYN
                             (stern)
                         This is the last time I'm covering
                         for you, friend. Next time, you're
                         on your own.

                                   LINDI
                         But you've seen what he's like.

                                   TARYN
                         You're twenty one Lindi. You can't
                         be lying to your father every time
                         you want to go clubbing. 

                                   LINDI
                         What do you want me to do? As soon
                         as I open my mouth, it's
                             (mimics Titus)
                         As long as you live under my roof. 
                             (beat)
                         Can you imagine what would happen
                         if I told him I was going out? He
                         won't even let me date. He thinks
                         all guys just want to have sex.

                                   TARYN
                         Maybe he's right. Remember the last
                         guy?

               She walks off, leaving Lindi to chew on that.



               INT. MAGISTRATE'S COURT - DAY

               A Music CD case with the portraits of Nails and Tooth, and
               titled "Tooth and Nails: We Back Haters", in TOOTH'S HAND.

                                   TOOTH
                         For you my friend. Half-price.
                         Forty. Law enforcement special.

               The BAILIFF snorts at the CD Tooth's peddling. 

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Okay. Thirty. Take it before I
                         change my mind.

               A hand taps his shoulder. Tooth wheels around to find KING
               PIN. King Pin grabs the CD.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Hey!

               King Pin grabs his collar, leans in close.

                                   KING PIN
                         And I want my recording equipment
                         back too. And my laptop. Otherwise
                         I'll--

                                   BAILIFF
                         All rise!

               The MAGISTRATE walks in, followed by a smiling ELMARIE. Tooth
               and King Pin hurry back to their seats.

                                   MAGISTRATE
                         Will the accused rise.

               Tooth and Nails comply.

                                   MAGISTRATE (CONT'D)
                         Anasthasius Shonge and Sospeter
                         Ntinti.

               Tooth and Nails cringe.

                                   MAGISTRATE (CONT'D)
                         You are hereby sentenced to fifty
                         hours community service in the
                         Youth Harvest Ministry Church in
                         Orlando West. 

               ON Tooth and Nails - recognizing the name. Nails nudges
               Tooth, excited. This is way better than sewage cleanup.

                                   MAGISTRATE (CONT'D)
                         You will be reporting to Pastor
                         Jeff Moloi, and your legal adviser
                         Miss Elmarie Van Zyl will monitor
                         you and submit regular progress
                         reports back to the department.

                                   AUNT JABU
                         Hayibo! Church?! No master. You
                         mean jail! 

               King Pin is on his feet in protest.

                                   KING PIN
                         What about my equipment?

               The Magistrate BANGS his gavel.

                                   MAGISTRATE
                         Case closed! Next!

               Aunt Jabu is racked by sobs. King Pin shouts after the
               magistrate. The PANDEMONIUM is lost of Tooth and Nails. 

                                   NAILS
                             (beaming)
                         Ekse. Your ex-bebeza. Coming soon.

               ON Tooth. That's precisely what he's afraid of.

                                   TITUS (PRE-LAP)
                         I'm looking forward to seeing them.

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. PASTOR TITUS'S OFFICE � DAY

               DARK. DREARY. FOREBODING. Shelves stacked high with books.
               One solitary window. A large FRAMED PICTURE of an elderly man
               on the wall - plaque reads "Bishop Zerubbabel Phakathi". 

                                   TITUS 
                             (into phone)
                         Pleasure is all mine.

               He HANGS UP THE PHONE as the door OPENS and SAM skitters in,
               with a cup of tea on a tray. 

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                             (off Sam's look)
                         The Community Service Program
                         starts tomorrow.

               Sam plonks down the tray.

                                   SAM
                         But moruti. What if they actually
                         turn out to be wild animals who
                         can't be controlled and they take
                         over the place and technically we
                         won't be able to send them back
                         because--

               Titus gets up, pats him reassuringly.

                                   TITUS
                         Relax my boy. I'll break them in --
                             (beat)
                         Personally. 

               He wanders across to the portrait, runs his fingers over the
               edge.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         Finally. Young people who can do
                         constructive work around here. Not
                         singing in silly little
                         competitions.

               He misses the hurt feeling that flickers across Sam's face.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                             (excited)
                         Digging. Gardening. Painting.
                         Tiling. Discipline my boy.
                         Discipline! 

               He looks up at the portrait in seeming adoration.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         Finally the Bishop will see that
                         I'm better than only being Jeff's
                         co-deputy sub-assistant pastor.

               Awkward silence for a beat. He notices Sam's glumness.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                             (teasing)
                         We'll need someone to write up the
                         rules for them.

                                   SAM
                             (excited)
                         Really?

               Titus gives him a smug nod. Sam salutes.

                                   SAM (CONT'D)
                         On it moruti!

               He bounds out. Titus gazes at the portrait, smiling.
                                   END ACT TWO
                                    ACT THREE



               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE CHURCH � DAY

               Outside the gate of the Church.

               THEMBI (20), a gorgeous and curvaceous black girl in a short,
               form fitting dress and massive shades stands beneath a sign -
               "YOUTH HARVEST MINISTRY". 

               She's SUCKING A LOLLIPOP.

               A Mercedes Benz S500 (or any other car of a similar ilk)
               pulls up. The uniformed CAUCASIAN driver, JAMES, steps out
               and RACES around the back to open the car door but --

                                   NIKI (O.S.)
                         I can let myself out James.

               NIKI (20), black, attractive in jeans, sneakers and a t-shirt
               steps out.

               She takes in the surroundings.

                                   NIKI (CONT'D)
                         Okay James. Thank you. 
                             (beat, off James's
                              inaction)
                         Shoo!

                                   JAMES
                         Might I remind you Miss Nicole that
                         your father placed me under strict
                         instructions not to--

                                   NIKI
                         OMG.
                             (changing tack)
                         When was the last time you saw
                         Marietjie? 

               James blushes.

                                   NIKI (CONT'D)
                         Take the day off, James. I'll
                         handle dad.

               He gives her a tense nod, gets into the car and pulls away.
               Niki spots Thembi.

                                   NIKI (CONT'D)
                         Hey. This is Youth Harvest right?

               Thembi looks her up and down.

                                   THEMBI
                             (in vernac)
                         Here we greet first.

                                   NIKI
                             (in posh-accented vernac)
                         Good day. I'm Niki.

                                   THEMBI
                         Thembi.

               They shake. Every time Thembi speaks, she speaks in vernac,
               and Niki replies in a mish-mash of broken vernac and English. 

                                   THEMBI (CONT'D)
                         This is Youth Harvest.

                                   NIKI
                         Are you here for community service?

                                   THEMBI
                             (wide-eyed surprise)
                         Wow chomi. Ja. Are you psychic? 

                                   NIKI
                         No I'm like here for like the same
                         thing.

                                   THEMBI
                         One of my exes was psychic. He
                         tried to read my mind one day and
                         just went blank.

                                   NIKI
                         Ag shame man. You must be very
                         complicated.

                                   THEMBI
                         Ja, I know.

               They walk into the gate side by side.



               EXT. CHURCH YARD - DAY

               NIKI and THEMBI pause inside the gates. They look around,
               unsure where to go.

               TITUS and SAM come round the back, Sam lugging ORANGE
               OVERALLS. Titus walks up to them with a beaming smile.

                                   TITUS
                             (fake smile)
                         The criminals, I presume?

                                   THEMBI
                         Huh?

               Niki half-nods.

                                   TITUS
                             (drops the smile)
                         You're late-- 
                             (to Sam)
                         Hand them their uniforms.

               Niki and Thembi's eyes widen as Sam pushes the overalls into
               their hands.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         We need a ditch around the back to
                         reduce the flooding when it rains.
                             (to Sam)
                         Get the shovels my boy.

               Sam goes off. Niki and Thembi still look bewildered. Where on
               earth did this guy come from?

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                             (off their confusion)
                         I am Pastor Titus. It's my job to
                         make you upstanding citizens of
                         society over the next few months.
                             (beat, he realizes
                              something)
                         Where are the rest of your friends?
                         There's supposed to be four of you.

               Right on cue, TOOTH and NAILS come sauntering through the
               gate, hands in their pockets, whistling. 

                                   TOOTH
                         Ekse majitas.

                                   NAILS
                         Hola hola.

               We follow them as they stroll past Titus and the girls, and
               hold ON TITUS, FUMING. At a loss for words.

               Sam comes around the corner lugging SHOVELS.

                                   TOOTH
                         Samza!

                                   SAM
                         Tooth!

                                   NAILS
                         Hola Samizo!

               Hi-fives, buddy hugs. did tooth and nails used to go to this
               church? How do they know sam? If they know sam and tooth
               dated lindi, how come he doesn't know her father titus?
               i think it would be best to have a small recap of the first
               movie at the beginning to clue in viewers who would have
               never seen the first one. And a few references to the
               connections from the first movie would be very useful in the
               first act as well. 

                                   SAM
                         What are you guys doing here? Are
                         you coming through for the next
                         talent camp again? It's only in
                         December.

                                   NAILS
                         No bra. We're here for community
                         what what. 

               Tooth fishes out a crumpled paper from his pocket, reads.

                                   TOOTH
                         We're meant to see some Titus guy.
                         As in tight-ass. Ha ha!

                                   NAILS
                         How come he wasn't on the camp Sam?
                         I thought Moruti Jeff was the only
                         pastor here.

                                   TOOTH
                         Because we would have needed extra
                         brooklax.

               He and Tooth are killing themselves. They freeze off Sam's
               shit-scared look. They swivel around to find--

               TITUS. He levels them with his unblinking death stare, shoves
               the overalls into their hands. 

                                   TITUS
                         You're late. The others are getting
                         changed already. Move it.

               Tooth stares at the overalls.

                                   TOOTH
                         Mara orange. Hau! Can't we add some
                         blue somewhere? This year I'm going
                         understated nyana --

               Titus's glare FREEZES the words in his mouth.



               EXT. CHURCH YARD - DAY

               TOOTH, NAILS, THEMBI and NIKI in orange overalls stand in
               line. Thembi's sucking a lollipop. Nails ogles her. Titus,
               CLIPBOARD in hand, strides past them a la military inspection
               style. Tooth clears his throat, steps forward.

                                   TOOTH
                         Praise God pastor. Where is Pastor
                         Jeff? We haven't seen him since the
                         camp.

                                   TITUS
                             (barks)
                         Speak when spoken to, boy!

               Tooth retreats feinging submission.

                                   TOOTH
                         Ameni, Pastor.

                                   TITUS
                         Nicole Motswading.

                                   NIKI
                         Niki -- Or Nikiwe. Not the name of
                         the oppressor. 

                                   TITUS
                             (ignores her, reads)
                         Nicole Motswading. Driving at three
                         hundred and ten kilometres per hour
                         on the N12.
                             (beat, huh?)
                         Opted for community service instead
                         of a fine?

                                   NIKI
                             (folds her hands
                              defiantly)
                         Told the parents I didn't need a
                         new Aston for my 21st. So I got it
                         impounded. Ha! Showed them!

               And that just hangs there for a few seconds. Just who exactly
               are this girl's parents? Titus continues.

                                   TITUS
                         Thembi Phiri-- 
                             (What the hell?)
                         Take that --thing-- out your mouth.

               Thembi licks the lollipop lasciviously, holds it out to
               Titus. Titus's eyes narrow.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                             (reads off the clipboard)
                         Resisting arrest.
                             (beat, raises an eyebrow)
                         By seducing a police officer?

                                   THEMBI
                         So now it's my fault everyone wants
                         to tap this?

               Titus chokes, straightens his tie. Tooth and Nails GIGGLE.
               Titus is glad for the distraction--

                                   TITUS
                         Tooth and Nails-- What sort of
                         names are those?

                                   THEMBI
                         Maybe their parents were dentists --
                         Or manicurists. 

                                   NAILS
                         Those are our artist names.

                                   TOOTH
                         We keep it real ko-Pimville. I'm
                         tough. Like teeth.

                                   NAILS
                         And I'm hard. Like Nails.

               They strike the same pose as they had on their album cover. 

                                   TITUS
                         Tough guys. Great. You two can
                         start digging first.

               Tooth's wheels grind overtime. He spots someone walking past
               in the background.

                                   TOOTH
                         Hey! Isn't that Pastor Jeff.

               He races off.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Pastor Jeff! Wait! It's me, Tooth.

               On Titus. Caught off-guard. Not sure how to react to this.
               Then-- his brow darkens. These boys think they're clever,
               huh?



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM � DAY

               JEFF and TOOTH walking in the auditorium. TOOTH's on the
               defensive.

                                   TOOTH
                         Nine nine it wasn't our fault this
                         time, moruti.

               Jeff pauses in front of the EMPTY TROPHY CABINET, downcast.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                         Excuses Tooth. 
                             (beat)
                         Remember at the camp, I made you my
                         personal project? And you failed. 
                             (beat)
                         So I failed. 

                                   TOOTH
                         Hau don't be like that Pastor.

               Jeff faces the trophy cabinet.

                                   JEFF
                         Let me tell you a story, son. You
                         see this empty cabinet?

               Tooth nods, unsure. 

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         It used to be full of trophies. We
                         were the National Praise and
                         Worship champions, year in year
                         out. The youth had substance back
                         then. The cabinet was full.

               Tooth glances at Jeff. So what?

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         Now it's empty. Because the youth
                         are empty. All you do is drugs.
                         Crime. Prostitution.

                                   TOOTH
                         Crime? Since when?

                                   JEFF
                         For years now I've been trying to
                         get our youth to revive the Praise
                         and Worship. Because if they are
                         united around something, they will
                         stand.

               He puts his hand on Tooth's shoulder.

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         But they have failed. No, actually.
                         I have failed them.
                             (beat)
                         And I have failed you Tooth.

               Jeff trudges away. Tooth just stares at the cabinet, lost for
               words. He'd have preferred a good tongue-lashing to this
               guilt-trip. 



               EXT. CHURCH YARD - DAY

               NAILS, THEMBI and NIKI are shovelling away. 

                                   THEMBI
                         At least they could've told me not
                         to get my weekly manicure.  

               Niki carries on digging with gusto.

                                   NIKI
                         Quit whining babe and just get on
                         with it.

                                   THEMBI
                         You know, just coz I'm not a rich
                         daddy's girl like you doesn't mean
                         you can talk to me like that. 
                             (beat, sniffs)
                         I was almost famous. I've been on
                         TV.

                                   NAILS
                         Yes! Now I remember you. You were
                         on Songstars that one time.

               Niki laughs.

                                   THEMBI
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                   NIKI
                         Almost famous, hey? Lemme guess.
                         You got the wooden spoon, right?

                                   THEMBI
                         Hey! Just because you weren't
                         blessed with a voice and a body to
                         match doesn't mean you've got to
                         hate.

                                   NIKI
                         FYI, the only reason I wasn't on
                         songstar was because my parents
                         wouldn't let me.

                                   THEMBI
                         Yeah whatever.

               Niki holds the shovel - transforming it into a microphone.
               She breaks into a SONG. Thembi and Nails look on, awed by her
               powerful, mature, beautiful voice. 

               Thembi's not to be outdone. She holds her shovel and starts
               singing also. They're in perfect harmony. Nails jumps in, his
               deep rich tenor blending in. 

               MUSICAL NUMBER: The TRIO finds its groove and they fall into
               step in a well synchronized dance. 

               ON TOOTH. He trudges into the yard. He HALTS when he sees--

               THEMBI, NIKI and NAILS SIGNING AND DANCING. 

               TOOTH stares in wide eyed wonderment. It's beautiful. Whoever
               would have expected such talent right here under-- 

               SHRIEK! Thembi clutches her finger.

                                   THEMBI (CONT'D)
                         My nail!

                                   NIKI
                             (mocking)
                         OMG. Did you break it?

                                   THEMBI
                         No. Worse. It fell off.

               She and Niki scour the ground. 

                                   NIKI
                         Found it!

               Thembi grabs it. 

                                   THEMBI
                         Thanks chomi. I've got to get it
                         cleaned and get it back on.

                                   NIKI
                         Come babe I'll help you.

               They go off, reconciled. Nails turns to Tooth, beaming.

                         Bru wami, I'm in love.

               He sighs.

                         I'll beg. I'll steal. I'll get a
                         job. Love will conquer all. 

               Tooth has a brainwave.

                                   TOOTH
                         Thankfully, I have a better plan.

               He leans into Nails, conspiratorially.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Listen. Did you see the way you
                         guys were singing just now?

               Nails starts shaking his head, he sees where this is going.
               Tooth continues, more earnestly.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         We take these girls, neh. We take
                         King Pin's equipment. We record
                         them. Make an album. Quick money.
                         Simple.

                         You're saying you're going to take
                         these girls to our shack and record
                         them there?

                                   TOOTH
                         Nah, that's the beauty of it. They
                         won't know we're recording them.

                                   NAILS
                         They won't?

                                   TOOTH
                         They won't. Moruti Jeff wants a
                         Praise and Worship team. So what we
                         do is...
                             (beat, emphatic)
                         We  convince him to let us do
                         Praise and Worship instead of this
                         prison camp. Then, we pretend to be
                         all praisy and worshippy, on the
                         side we're recording them then
                         BOOM!

               He paints the picture with a broad sweep of his hands.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Can you see it?

                                   NAILS
                         See what?

                                   TOOTH
                         The picture. We're going to be
                         millionaires. We'll record a
                         platinum album and sell gold. And
                             (smiles)
                         You'll get the cherry on top.

               He makes the "cherry gesture" - touching his nipples. Nails
               smiles. He's liking this picture. A thought crosses his mind.

                                   NAILS
                         And if Jeff say's no?



               TOOTH GRINS.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                         No!

               He gets up from his chair and paces the room. TOOTH's jaw
               drops. NAILS shrugs. TITUS smirks from his seat in the
               corner.

                                   TOOTH
                             (incredulous)
                         Why not?

                                   TITUS
                         If you boys sing who'll do all the
                         work that needs to be done around
                         here.

                                   NAILS
                         Moruti, you've got two artistes, a
                         kasi queen and Motsepe's daughter.
                         We can't dig trenches to save our
                         lives. But we can sing...

                                   TOOTH
                         Nine nine it's the best way for us
                         to serve the community. 

               Jeff's is deep in thought. He looks at Tooth. Nails. Titus.

                                   TITUS
                         Don't tell me you're even
                         considering this.
                             (off Jeff's silence)
                         They were sent here to do community
                         service, not to sing.

                                   JEFF
                         But community service is about
                         serving the community, isn't it?

                                   TITUS
                         Yes, but--

                                   JEFF
                             (to Tooth and Nails)
                         Can you sing gospel?

               Tooth and Nails nod.

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         Can you lead a Praise and Worship
                         team?

                             (easy-peezy)
                         Praise and Worship? Easy.

                                   JEFF
                         Can you get it to the National
                         Praise and Worship qualifiers?

                                   TOOTH
                         Wow! That's brilliant pastor.
                         National competition? I'd never
                         have thought of that!

               He winks at Nails. Nails looks away - he doesn't have Tooth's
               game face.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         We can most definitely get them to
                         that National what what.

                         I don't think we're qualified to
                         make that call, Titus.
                             (to Tooth and Nails)
                         I'll give you one week.

                 One week?                What for?

                                   PASTOR JEFF (CONT'D)
                         To get a praise team together and
                         prepare a song. If I like what I
                         see, then we're in business. If not
                             (beat, lets the silence
                              hang)
                         It's back to the trenches for all
                         of you.

                         One week is too little!

               Jeff resumes his seat.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                         One week. Take it or leave it.

               Tooth and Nails exchange a look. 

                                   NAILS
                         Okay. 
                             (beat)
                         One week.

               Jeff leans back, satisfied at having twisted their arm.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                         Just one more thing.

                         These are Niki and Thembi. You'll
                         have plenty of time to get to know
                         each other.

                                   TARYN
                         You keep telling us about bad
                         apples moruti. What if we end up
                         being criminals like them?

                                   SAM
                         Judicially speaking, Taryn, they're
                         not criminals. They're miscreants.

                                   TARYN
                         Who asked you? It's the same
                         difference. Look, they even have
                         the same uniform.

                                   NIKI
                         If it's all the same to you, I
                         don't mind not singing with you
                         either.

                                   THEMBI
                         Huh? Ja.  
                             (re: Niki)
                         Me too.

                                   TARYN
                         Then why don't you just go back to--

                                   JEFF
                         Enough!

               They're silent.

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         Now. Listen carefully all of you --
                         you especially Taryn and Lungi.

               Nails smirks at Lungi. Taryn rolls her eyes.

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         This is your last opportunity to
                         get into the qualifiers with this
                         Church. You'd better get
                         professional very quickly guys,
                         otherwise you'll be made to look
                         like idiots. Your choice.

               He sweeps the room with his eyes - daring anyone to renege.
               No takers. 

                                   JEFF (CONT'D)
                         Good. Happy rehearsing. 
                             (beat)
                         Tooth. Take it from here.

                                   SAM
                         Hey! I was next in line.

                                   JEFF
                         The shepherd is nothing without his
                         sheep, Sam. 

               Sam sulks. Jeff walks out. Tooth turns to the others. Doom
               and gloom all around him.

                                   TOOTH
                         Okay. Guys. How about we just give
                         it a try and take it from there,
                         hey?

                                   NIKI
                         So is it like for def that we can
                         sing instead of like dig?

                                   TOOTH
                             (looks her straight in the
                              eye)
                         Yes it is.

                                   NIKI
                         Okay. I'm in.

                                   THEMBI
                         Me too.

                                   TOOTH
                         Great. That's the spirit. Let's
                         start with something upbeat. How
                         about  "Kehtla Hopa Kadiyakhla". On
                         the count of three--

                                   NAILS
                         Maybe we should stand according to
                         our voices Tooth.

                                   TOOTH
                         I got this baftwethu. Trust me.

               Tooth cues them. They sound awful. Off key. Tooth scratches
               his head: this isn't working. He glimpses a movement at the
               door from the corner of his eye, snaps around to see--

               LINDI.

               Awkward momnet of recongition. She takes in his orange
               overalls. She's not really sure why he's there but she ain't
               sticking around to find out. She spins around and heads off.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Take five bafwethu. Rest your
                         voices. Gargle water. And -- do
                         some breathing exercises, ja.

               And he's darts out. On the puzzled faces of THE GROUP as
               Tooth--



               INT. CHURCH CORRIDOR - DAY

               -- Dashes after LINDI.

                                   TOOTH
                         Lindi!

               Lindi just keeps on walking. TOOTH follows.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Lindi. Can we talk? 

               She carries on. He grabs her hand, spins her around.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Lindi, I've told you. I'm sorry.
                         You acting like nothing happened
                         between us.

                                   LINDI
                         Wasn't that the problem?
                             (off Tooth's look)
                         That nothing happened between us?
                         So you cheated? Again.

               She starts to walk away. Tooth STANDS there for a second,
               stewing in her irony. He chases after her.

                                   TOOTH
                         Lindi. I was drunk. Kidy seduced
                         me. It wasn't my fault.

               Lindi stops.

                                   LINDI
                         The first time wasn't your fault.
                         Fine. But a second time? After we'd
                         been dating for six months? 

               Tooth gets close to her.

                                   TOOTH
                         Lindi--

                                   TITUS (O.S.)
                         So you're bunking your singing
                         classes also, hey?

               Tooth spins around to find TITUS, walking down the corridor
               towards them. Tooth recovers from the shock. He takes one
               last look at Lindi. She avoids his gaze. He slips away-back
               to the auditorium. 

               Titus turns to Lindi.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         What was that all about?

                                   LINDI
                         Nothing.

               She walks away. Titus watches her, thinking. It sure didn't
               seem like nothing to him.
                                   END ACT THREE
                                     ACT FOUR



               INT. PASTOR TITUS'S OFFICE - DAY

               TITUS paces up and down. SAM sits in front of him. It looks
               like a scene out of an interrogation.

                                   TITUS 
                         And what happened between them on
                         that camp?

                                   SAM
                         Factually speaking, nothing,
                         moruti. Tooth liked her but then I
                         think she caught him with some girl
                         and then she slapped him and then
                         he --

                                   TITUS
                         Did it go beyond that?

                                   SAM
                         Not really, technically. 
                             (off Titus' glare)
                         In fact, no.

                                   TITUS
                         How did he get his current inmates
                         to cooperate with him?

                                   SAM
                         You mean the community service
                         people? He promised them that they
                         won't have to do hard labour
                         anymore. Personally I found it
                         funny that you'd accept that but
                         then technically I--

                                   TITUS
                         I did no such thing.
                             (grimaces)
                         Pastor Jeff. It was his idea.

                                   SAM  
                         I'll go tell the others that he
                         lied. He's always lying. Even on
                         camp he--

               Titus shakes his head. Sam is deflated. Confused.

                                   TITUS  
                         Have I taught you nothing? We will
                         wait until the time is right. And
                         then--
                             (beat)
                         Crush. Definitively.

               Titus smirks. Sam nods. He understands.



               EXT. CHURCH YARD - DAY

               It's MORNING. TOOTH and NAILS lumber past the gate, lugging a
               bulky SPORTS BAG between them.

               The FLASHY CAR from earlier pulls up. Nails and Tooth gawk.  

                                   TOOTH
                         Sho sis Niki. Last number, neh?

                                   NAILS
                             (re: Tooth)
                         Next time give this Johnny Walker a
                         lift.

                                   NIKI
                             (embarrassed)
                         My parents won't let me use taxis.

                                   NAILS  
                         Magezas ko-Bryanston are rough,
                         neh?

                                   NIKI  
                             (defensive)
                         I used them all the time in Cape
                         Town till my parents found out and
                         forced me to move back to Joburg.

               A pimped-up, CITI GOLF pulls up. LOUD MUSIC rattles it's
               tinted windows. THEMBI steps out.

                                   TOOTH   
                             (to Nails, sotto voce)
                         It's your paola.

               Nails glimpses the driver. Tinge of jealousy on his face.

                                   THEMBI    
                         Sorry I'm late. I lost ibellas yami
                         again. What's the time?

                                   NAILS  
                         Who was that? Your Zuma?

                                   THEMBI   
                         He wishes. He's the manager at
                         Wandi's. I waitress there part
                         time. He always gives me a lift so
                         I can give him my new digits when I
                         lose my phone.

                                    TOOTH  
                         Why don't you just keep the same
                         number?

                                   THEMBI  
                         I never remember it. 

               Tooth and Nails exchange a look.

                                   TOOTH   
                             (aside to Nails)
                         Pentium two. Hade.

               Nails shakes his head. He's not going to let that stop him.
               They walk into the church grounds. 



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM � DAY

               TOOTH, NAILS, NIKI and THEMBI walk into the rehearsal space.
               SAM, LUNGI and TARYN waiting for them. 

                                   TARYN
                         Day one and you guys are already
                         late.

                                   SAM    
                         Actually, it's day two.

                                   LUNGI   
                         This is what I get for giving my
                         time to amateurs who know jack
                         about music.

               Tooth puts down the bag, unzips it, takes out a SOUND BOARD,
               CABLES and couple of MICS from the bag.

                         Wow! Check it out!

               He dives at the bag and starts turning the equipment over,
               gazing adoringly.

                                   THEMBI    
                         What is it?

                         What is it? It's only an 8-track

                         chief.

               Lunga crosses his arms. He's got to see it to believe it.    



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM � DAY

               Orange sound bars PEAKING up and down on the mixer.

               THE GROUP is SINGING the same song from before. They're
               bored. Unexcited.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Heish! Majitas. Zimile.-- Okay.

                         bafwethu.

               Tooth's not listening. He's looking at the door, where --

               LINDI stands watching. She catches his eye, turns and leaves.

                                   TOOTH   
                         Mara why can't she sing with us.

                         Dammit!

               Sam drops to his knees, joins his hands, starts muttering.

                                   SAM
                         Dear God please forgive his heathen
                         devil tongue. He doesn't know
                         better, theologically speaking.

                         They begged me to stay, but I said

               She takes her cellphone out, turns the video camera on.
               Tooth's mind is whizzing away.

                                   TOOTH
                         That's it! We need inspiration.

                         This is going to work.

               He gives them his million dollar smile. It's lost on Nails,
               smarting under the blow he's just received in public.



               EXT. CHURCH YARD � DAY

               NAILS is on a bench. Headphones on. Bumping his head. Really
               into it. A hand taps his shoulder. He looks up to see

               NIKI.

                                   NIKI   
                         Hey bhuti.

               She sits next to him. He takes the headphones off. She
               reaches for them.

                                   NIKI   (CONT'D)
                         Can I?

               He helps her put them on. She listens for a beat.

                         Just saying.

               Nails watches her go. The thought lingers for a beat. Let's
               it go- turns back to his music. 



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM - DAY

               A PULPIT graces the stage where The Group had been a few
               minutes before. TITUS paces up and down, literally BASHING
               HIS BIBLE.

                                   TITUS
                         Hell and damnation brothers and
                         sisters! Hell and damnation.
                         Brimstone and fire on the last day.
                             (pauses, jots on a notepad
                              as he mutters)
                         Fire and Brimstone. Better.
                             (resumes full force)
                         Fire and Brimstone my brothers and
                         sisters. Fire and Brimstone!

               He pauses again. He senses someone's watching. He turns
               around to see--

                                   LINDI
                         Sorry to interrupt papa. Can we -
                         talk?

               Titus dabs his sweaty forehead and face with a LARGE POLKA
               DOTTED HANDKERCHIEF. Lindi takes this as permission granted.
               She approaches.

                                   LINDI (CONT'D)
                         Papa. If it's possible, I'd like to
                         have your -- blessing -- to join
                         the new Praise--.

               She falters off his withering look. Titus is DUMBFOUNDED.
               What? Did he hear right? He let's the question hang
               unanswered in the air for a couple of beats.

                                   TITUS
                         We agreed on this already.

                                   LINDI
                         I'm asking again Papa. 

               Titus thinks about this for a second -- trying to find the
               words to explain.

                                   TITUS
                         My girl. I cannot allow it. You
                         know my reasons.

               Lindi's eyes well up.

                                   LINDI
                             (voice breaking)
                         I'm not going to end up like Ma,
                         Papa. Please.

               Titus restrains his simmering anger.

                                   TITUS
                             (not up for discussion)
                         Do you really want to make an issue
                         out of something so small?

                                   LINDI
                         If it's so small then let me sing.

                                   TITUS
                         As long as you're under my roof,
                         you will do as I say. Is that
                         clear?

                                   LINDI
                         Since when is singing a sin Papa?

               Now Titus loses it. But he doesn't shout. He never shouts. 

                                   TITUS
                         Since the day it leads a daughter
                         to disobey her father. You
                         disobeyed me by going to that silly
                         camp last year instead of doing the
                         bible course. 

               He approaches her.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         You disobey me by breaking curfew
                         every other night. You disobeyed me
                         by dating that boy Tooth.
                             (off her look)
                         Yes. I found out. 

               CLOSE ON Lindi, wide-eyed, tearing up. Titus softens.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         My girl, why don't you just focus
                         on becoming a deaconess? Sing every
                         Sunday. Sing on Wednesdays. But
                         this competition nonsense--no.

               Tense moment, each weighing the other's thoughts. Titus walks
               past her. Out on Lindi, holding back the anger. And also some
               tears.



               INT. CHURCH OF THE ANOINTED � DAY

               THE GROUP sneaks into a dark choir loft, overlooking a lit
               stage. On the stage, A WORSHIP TEAM of about six guys and
               gals arranging themselves. A CONDUCTOR stands at the front.

                                   LUNGI  
                         This sneaking around isn't safe.
                         What if I hurt myself.

                                   THEMBI  
                         Just follow me. I sneak around in
                         the dark all the time.

                                   TARYN  
                         Sam, your shoes are squeaking.

                                   SAM  
                         Sorry.

               He takes them off. His socks are mismatched. Niki squints up
               her nose.

                                   NIKI   
                         Two words. Talcum powder. 

                                   TOOTH   
                         Quiet guys. They're starting.

               They all sit low in their seats as --

               THE CONDUCTOR cues Anointed Vocals. They perform a
               traditional Praise and Worship Hymn. They're amazing.
               Polished. Professional. Suddenly --

               The singers PART like the Red Sea and --

               A well known Gospel Music SOPRANO DIVA walks through the
               parting as she SINGS. 

               THEMBI gasps. Lungi's hand flies to cover her mouth. 

               SOPRANO DIVA hits an INCREDIBLY HIGH NOTE.

               ON The Group. 

               Totally overawed.

               It's too much for Sam. He leaps to his feet and breaks into
               wild, rancorous APPLAUSE. Yelling and whooping. Nails tackles
               him to the floor. And Tooth sinks in his chair, thinking that
               this was such a bad idea. 



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM - DAY

               THE GROUP plods in. Their downcast faces register

                         decided as far as Moruti Titus is
                         concerned. So those trenches still
                         need digging, theoretically

               Tooth and Nails stare at each other. The auditorium is EMPTY.
               Just the two of them. Right back where they started.  



               INT. SHACK � EVENING

               TOOTH and NAILS just sit there. Quiet. The end of the road.

               The door BLASTS open--

                                   AUNT JABU  
                         Aha! So the millionaires are home,
                         eh? Where's my rent.

                         This month was slow at the car wash
                         Aunty.

               She doesn't care, stretches out her hand. Nails takes out a
               few notes. Hands them to her. Her hand remains outstretched. 

                                   TOOTH
                         Aunty, my mother, your only sister,
                         is turning in her grave right now.

                                   AUNT JABU  
                         Because I let you live here for
                         free most of the time. The rest.
                         Lethe.

               Tooth grudgingly pulls out more notes from his pocket, hands
               them over. Aunt Jabu counts them.

               really SHIT. Nails's listening.

               Tooth hangs his head in his hands, ashamed. Nails goes over
               to the laptop, places it by the mixer and fires it up, puts
               on his headphones. Out on Tooth - wondering what Nails's is
               on about.

               INT. CHURCH KITCHEN - DAY 

               THEMBI, NIKI and TOOTH cooking pap. They're back in their
               ORANGE OVERALLS. Niki takes a taste of the pap from the pot.

                         ... it's so plain.

                         It's pap. It's supposed to be
                         plain.

               TITUS strides in with SAM in tow. The three miscreants fall
               silent, exchange guilty looks.

                                   TITUS
                             (to Tooth)
                         Is your friend not here yet?

               NAILS races in, panting. Titus eyes him.

                         Taxis moruti. Those magezas need
                         Church.

               Titus levels him with his stare. Not sure if he's being made
               fun of. Nails gives his best angelic smile. He saunters off.
               Sam follows, an obedient dog.

               Nails takes his phone and a pair of earbuds out his pocket,
               gives them to Tooth. Tooth puts them on - not interested,
               then--

               He registers surprise. Is that? No, it can't be. Nails beams.

                         just.

               Tooth gives Nails a high five as--

                         pm sharp.

               Tooth registers SHOCK. Oh shit - was that TODAY?

                         Performance? Didn't you hear that--

                         Hear that we're very excited and
                         ready moruti.

               Jeff looks from Nails to Tooth. He smells a rat in this
               kitchen.

                                   PASTOR JEFF    
                         I hope you're not going to waste my
                         time again Tooth.

               He gives Pastor Jeff the earbuds. Plays the track off Nails's
               phone. Jeff is surpised then-- He beams, delighted.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         It's just a sneak peek of this
                         afternoon.

               Jeff pats him on the back.

                                   JEFF 
                         This is very very good. Well done
                         people. All of you.

               He gives them all heavy pats on the back. Thembi and Niki are
               clueless, squirm beneath the heavy blows to their backs.

                                   PASTOR JEFF   
                         Really looking forward to hearing

                         Tell them I said well done. Wait.
                         Silly me. I'll just call them.

               He whips out his phone and walks out, humming the tune he
               just heard, big smile on his face. Tooth basks in the
               momentary glory until -- it hits him. 

               He BOLTS out after Jeff, scattering the pots and pans.

               The confusion disappears from Lungi's face. He's starting to
               enjoy the attention.

                                   LUNGI    
                         Oh yeah yeah yeah. That was me. So
                         what did you think of that little
                         run I did at the end? Wasn't
                         planned. That was just me.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                         It was fantatic.



               INT. CHURCH CORRIDOR - DAY

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                             (into phone)
                         All of it was great. Looking
                         forward to seeing you all this
                         afternoon.

               TOOTH races up behind him.

                                   TOOTH   
                         Moruti. I er--

               Jeff hangs up, turns to Tooth, all energetic.

                                   TOOTH   (CONT'D)
                         I think maybe you mustn't call the
                         others--
                             (off Jeff's bewilderment)
                         You might just stress them out.

               Jeff registers comprehension.

                                   JEFF   
                         Of course. Performance anxiety. Got
                         you.

               Gives Tooth a wink and a pat on the back just as--

               LINDI turns the corner in time to catch this moment.

               Jeff trots off, humming Kehtla Hopa Kadiyakhla. He goes past
               Lindi, gives her a smile and a nod. ON Lindi, trying to
               process all this. She turns to Tooth, perplexed.

                                   TOOTH
                             (off her look)
                         He's excited about the performance
                         this afternoon.

                                   LINDI   
                         Wasn't it called off?

                                   TOOTH  
                         Sort of. Not really. Yeah.
                             (off her puzzlement)
                         Mamela.

               He gives the earbuds and Nails's phone. Her face lights up in
               surprise.

                                   LINDI   
                         Wow! Is that you guys?
                             (beat)
                         That's really good work guys.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Kejive. I have a song but no group. 
                             (beat, off her look)
                         They all walked out on me. It was
                         my fault. Jeff's going to moere me
                         when he finds out.

                                   LINDI  
                         I wish I could help.

               Tooth considers this for a beat.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Can't you? Or won't you. I've seen
                         you watching us at every rehearsal. 

               And that just hangs there for a few seconds. She bites her
               lip.

                                   TOOTH   (CONT'D)
                         Hade. That was unfair. Didn't mean
                         it like that.

                                   LINDI  
                         No, you're right. At least you've
                         tried. I've just chickened because--

               She trails off. Tooth edges closer.

                                   TOOTH   
                         I miss you Lindi. I miss hearing
                         you sing -- When I could hear you
                         sing every day--I wished that could
                         last forever.

               The moment is charged. Sparks of their old chemistry. He
               edges towards her--

                                   SAM (O.S.)   
                         Ahem--

               Tooth turns around to find SAM blinking at them. Awkward
               moment.

                                   SAM   (CONT'D)
                         You're actually needed back in the
                         kitchen Tooth. Someone put butter
                         in the pap so you guys have to go
                         buy more mealie meal and start
                         over. 

               He gives them one last inquisitive blink, skitters off. The
               moment broken, Lindi turns and hurries away. Tooth watches
               her go, not sure what could've happened.



               EXT. STREET - DAY

               LUNGI's on the phone.

                                   LUNGI   
                         So I was like yeah Pastor Jeff. You
                         know how we do. 
                             (chuckles)
                         Dude was like so looking forward to
                         seeing me perform, T. Even had to
                         hang up on him.

                                   TARYN   
                         You what?

                                   LUNGI  
                         Hang up. I was respectful though.

                                   TARYN   
                         Could you get over yourself for
                         once? You said we're performing
                         this afternoon?

                                   LUNGI   
                         No Pastor Jeff said. Why you
                         getting so mad girl. It was about
                         damn time someone 'round here--
                         hello? Hello?

               Damn! She's hung up on him. Lungi's shrugs -- Hater's gonna
               hate.



               INT. CHURCH KITCHEN - DAY 

               SAM's in the kitchen tasting the pap. He smells it, bites.
               Rolls it around his mouth. Closes his eyes. Ah, so good. His
               phone RINGS, breaking his moment.

                                   TARYN   
                         Listen you. The performance is on
                         this afternoon. You'd better be
                         there.

                                   SAM  
                         Taryn. But I thought you walked out
                         and it got cancelled and--

                                   TARYN  
                         You thought nothing. Call the rest
                         of your nerd friends and cancel
                         whatever you had planned this
                         afternoon.

                                   SAM  
                         It was our Animal Planet meeting.
                         We'd rented mating habits of the
                         porcupine. That's so unfair  --
                         hello? Hello? Taryn?

               She's hung up on him. Sam sulks, grabs a huge lump of pap and
               chucks it in his mouth. 



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM � DAY

               A BUNCH OF FORMS are on JEFF's lap.

               CUT WIDE to reveals JEFF and TITUS seated in the auditorium.
               Jeff glances at his watch, edgy. TITUS is annoyed.

                                   TITUS   
                         Let's go. They're wasting our time.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                         A cake tastes better after it's
                         cooled, Titus. Patience. 

                                   TITUS   
                         The sunday bulletin won't print
                         itself. We've given them ten
                         minutes already --

               The doors FLING wide and TOOTH, NIKI, NAILS and THEMBI burst
               in.

                                   NIKI   
                         Well soo-rry if I didn't sweep
                         properly. We've got a butler for
                         that.

                                   THEMBI   
                         How's about we sweep tomorrow. I've
                         got a psych report on wunga smoking
                         due. And I've got like thirty
                         volunteers.

               The girls stop, surprised to see Titus and Jeff. Tooth and
               Nails take it all in stride.

                                   NAILS
                             (welcoming)
                         Men of God.

                                   TITUS   
                         You're late. Where are the others?

                                   TOOTH   
                         The others?-- Aren't they here yet?

                                   TITUS  
                         Does it look like it?

               Tooth and Nails glance at each other for an awkward beat. We
               see the moment Tooth decides to give up and come clean.

                                   TOOTH  
                         The thing is moruti--

               The doors BLAST open.

                                   TARYN
                         ... why must you guys always make
                         me late for everything.

                                   LUNGI   
                         It was ten percent off on the
                         carvelas. I couldn't just leave.

               SAM, LUNGI and TARYN stumble in. SAM drags his feet, locks
               eyes with Titus. He shrugs in resignation -- he tried. Titus
               glowers. Jeff brightens.

                                   TOOTH   
                         Here they are moruti. The full
                         team.

                                   NAILS   
                         We're ready.

                                   NIKI   
                         Ready for what?

               She looks from face to face. It dawns on her.

                                   NIKI   (CONT'D)
                         But didn't you like say we were
                         supposed to sweep this place again?

                                   TARYN   
                         Oh, so you just seem to be lying to
                         everyone now, hey.

                                   TOOTH   
                         Bafwethu. I just needed to get you
                         all together so we could do this
                         thing we all want to do guys. We'll
                         still have to clean this place
                         anyways.

                                   THEMBI
                         Oh I get it. Classic withdrawal
                         from reality by creating an
                         escapist fantasy.

                                   SAM
                         Psych major?

                                   THEMBI
                         No. Celebrity Rehab with Doctor
                         Drew.

               Tooth nods to Nails. Nails crosses to the PA system. Plugs
               his phone in. 

               MUSIC PERMEATES through the space. Confused looks. That
               sounds like them.

                                   TOOTH   
                         Just like we rehearsed guys.

               The music CUTS TO INSTRUMENTAL. Nails takes the stage.

                                   NAILS   
                         Come guys. Let's do this.

               THE GROUP takes one look at the scowling Titus, the expectant
               Jeff. Taryn gets onto the stage. Niki, Thembi and Lungi
               follow. A hesitant Sam is the last on stage. Tooth clambers
               up and CONDUCTS them.

                                   TOOTH   
                         One two three. Yeah!

               They break into the song SEAMLESSLY.

               MUSICAL NUMBER: After a few beats an up tempo beat kicks in
               and the Group starts moving to the music, a spontaneous dance
               routine, that's well orchestrated and choreographed in our
               world of musical prodigies. Even Sam minimizes his bad
               dancing. 

               Pastor Jeff smiles. It's way better LIVE. Suddenly--

               A vivacious, soulful voice JOINS IN the harmony. They all
               look up at the door to see--

               LINDI

               Walking into the auditorium. Singing her heart out. Not
               missing a beat. Not faltering on any note. She blends in
               beautifully with the rest of them (even if this is the first
               time she's singing the song). Perfectly acceptable in our
               world of prodigies.

               The Group gladly makes space for her on the stage. Jeff casts
               a glance at Titus. Titus's face is a mask of betrayal.
               Embarrassment. Humiliation. Rage.

               He storms out. Lindi's smile disappears. But she sings on.
               And on. Nothing and no one will stop her from doing what she
               wants. From chasing her dream.

               Jeff witnesses this little exchange and shrugs. What else can
               he do? He enjoys what's left of the music, dancing as only he
               can - Madiba style. 

               The song ends. Jeff breaks into applause. He's only one man
               but he makes up for it with his sheer emotional intensity. 

                                   PASTOR JEFF   
                         Bravo! Finally! A Praise and
                         Worship team! 

               The Group beams, and bows.

                                   PASTOR JEFF   (CONT'D)
                         I was touched. I was moved. I was--
                         I was --

                                   TOOTH   
                         About to sign the forms moruti.

               Jeff smiles. Picks up the forms. The Group hi-five each
               other.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                             (reading off the forms)
                         Team name?

               Silence. Their minds are whirring. No one had thought about
               this before.--

                                   NAILS   
                         Remix!

               Everyone turns and stares at Nails. He meets their stares,
               confident.

                                   NAILS   (CONT'D)
                         That's what we're all about.
                         Remixing the old to make something
                         new.

               The others nod. It makes sense. Jeff considers this for a
               second.

                                   PASTOR JEFF   
                         I like it. Remix. Sounds catchy.
                         Remix it is.

               He scribbles on the forms for a beat. Stands up.

                                   PASTOR JEFF   (CONT'D)
                         Well done people. You have made me
                         very proud today. I have full faith
                         that you will give it your all and
                         bring Youth Harvest, National
                         Praise and Worship Competition
                         Glory. A round of applause to
                         Tooth.
                             (to Tooth)
                         Thank you for believing son.

               Tooth takes a bow. The newly-born REMIX whoop and cheer and
               hug each other. Pats on Tooth's back -- "Sho Tooth", "Ta
               mfethu", "You rock babe". 

               Out on Nails. Forcing a smile, looking hard done by. 



               EXT. STREET - DAY

               TOOTH and NAILS walk out the gate. Tooth is cheerful.
               Whistling. On top of the world. Nails trudges along, stonily
               silent.

                                   TOOTH   
                         En nou? What's with you?

               Nails looks away.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         I've known you seven years chief.
                         Don't start with those tendencies.

               The dam breaks.

                                   NAILS  
                         Why's it always you Tooth? Why
                         can't you say, just for once, it
                         was my idea. My plan that worked.

                                   TOOTH   
                         Hau. Next you'll want me to say I
                         love you. Must I bring you flowers
                         and chocolates too. 

               Tooth laughs out loud. Nails regards him for a beat.

                                   NAILS  
                         You just don't get it.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Get what? That we're sitting on
                         gold? That we've got an amazing
                         plan that's starting to work?
                         What's there to get?

               Nails levels him with a stare.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Check. We've got everyone sold on
                         this. We record their songs. Keep
                         the rights. And we're flying jo.

               He saunters off, beaming.

                                   TOOTH   (CONT'D)
                         We'll record a platinum album and
                         sell gold. Remember?

               Out on Nails - shaking his head in disbelief. 



               INT. PASTOR TITUS' OFFICE � DAY

               Dark. Dreary. Uninviting. LINDI steps in with a trace of
               timidity.

                                   LINDI
                         Yes Pa. You called me?

               The swivel chair swings round to reveal TITUS. He levels her
               with a frown. Lindi panics, knowing exactly what's coming.

                                   LINDI   (CONT'D)
                         Pa I had to do it. Singing is
                         everything to me. Can't you see
                         that? I don't want to become a
                         deaconness papa. That's not--

               He holds up a hand, cutting her off.

                                   TITUS  
                         If you stay with that group, you
                         can't stay in my house. You decide.

               Lindi gapes at him, stunned. And we milk this moment for all
               it's worth as we-- 

                                                       FADE  TO  BLACK.
