<!---6th February 2020--->

These difficult two weeks, after Melina passed away,  I guess have taught me the importance of resting my mind, not just my body. The more I rest my mind, the more myself I become...I guess I now know a little bit what burnout feels like...it hasn't been so extreme that I have no motivation to do anything...it hasn't been depression yet... I'm still keen to work and to do stuff like Toastmasters, thank God. But looking back, I can think of few other ways I would've been convinced that taking time out to rest my mind..,time that is separate from sleep... Is vital...

I think for me workaholism has always been an escape. I immerse myself in work so I don't have to confront my #fears. And I have many fears, Lord. Many many fears..all of which stem from a certain #doubt that God has been, is, and will be with me. And the hardest hardest point for me, Lord, is this one: Lord, if you are truly with me, but then why do things go badly or poorly, humanly speaking? I guess that supernatural outlook is actually a kind of #faith...and so its a supernatural gift.

When I am hit by #tragedy, and there will be more to come, it's very important to #rest. This thing of immersing myself in work and not "sitting on the mattress" is not good at all. Give me more faith, Lord. Give me more faith to overcome these fears, that I have avoided confronting:

1.  Fear of being sent back to Kenya to look for work there.
2.  Fear of not being able to sleep at night,
3.  Fear of leaving the work and running off with some woman.
4.  Fear of never ever seeing young numeraries in this region.
5.  Fear of professional success making me self-sufficient and proud.
6.  Fear of having been too willful in the past and letting God down because I did what I wanted to do professionally speaking.
7.  Fear of never finding my feet, professionally speaking because of the aspects I dislike about writing (dealing with execs), producing (admin) and novel writing (descriptions and editing)...

All my adult life, I have never felt that I "deserve" time to rest. But I see now that I am not Superman. So many people ask me "when do you rest, Fidel?" And I've never been able to answer that question. But now I see that basketball once a week, exercise for 20 minutes once a day... That's good but not enough...I actually need to carve out more time during the day when I just stop working.
