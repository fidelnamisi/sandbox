               EXT. CHURCH (ESTABLISHING) - DAY

               We are back in our now familiar church.



               INT. TITUS'S OFFICE - DAY

               TIGHT on KIDY. Wiping tears from her eyes.

                                   KIDY
                         I used to be such a good girl,
                         moruti. I don't know what happened.

               She rummages through her bag, sniffing. TITUS offers her a
               kleenex from the pack on his table.

                                   KIDY (CONT'D)
                         It was Satan. 

                She blows noisily, breaks into a fit of coughing.

                                   KIDY (CONT'D)     
                         I spent the whole night crying.
                             (beat, hopeful)
                         I couldn't even eat this morning.

                                   TITUS
                         Guilt is a terrible thing my
                         daughter. Terrible thing.

               Kidy chokes back tears, forces another bout of coughing.

                                   TITUS  (CONT'D)
                         We are all sinners. True - some of
                         us are bigger sinners than others
                         but--

               She sobs, clears her throat loud and long. 

                                   KIDY
                             (hoarse from crying)
                         Water. Some water please, moruti.

                                   TITUS
                         I'll get some tea.

               He leaves. At the sound of door slamming SHUT, Kidy's head
               snaps up. The facade drops. 

               She's a woman on a mission. Machine-like, she crosses over to
               the filing cabinet. Rifles through it. 

               Come on-- Come on--

               BINGO! She's found it. She holds up a file, glances at the
               first page. 

               CLOSE ON TOOTH'S MUGSHOT.

               She slams the cabinet shut and crosses back to her seat.
               Mission accomplished. And it's just in time as the door opens
               and --

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         Sam will bring it shortly.

               He sits on the edge of the table. Kidy hides her face in her
               kleenex.

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)  
                         As I was saying, evil is not the
                         answer child.

                                   KIDY
                         Yes, moruti. Of course.

               Kidy blows hard into the kleenex, covers her face to hide the
               glint in her eye. 



               EXT. TARYN'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

               We are outside Taryn's apartment door. It opens to reveal--

                                   TARYN   
                         What do you want?

               And the unceremonious greeting is reserved for none other
               than --

                                   TOOTH  
                         I need to ask you something. 
                             (beat)
                         Can I come in?

                                   TARYN  
                         Sorry. We have a strict policy
                         against criminals, pirates and
                         gintsas in this building.

               She wheels around. TOOTH sticks his foot in the door.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Nine-nine I deserve that. All I
                         need is a minute. That's all.

               TARYN considers this.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         I won't even dirty your chairs by
                         sitting.

               He cracks a hopeful grin - the million dollar smile. ON
               Taryn. Deadpan. She turns around and walks back in, leaving
               the door open. Tooth follows.



               INT. CHURCH KITCHEN - DAY

               LINDI lugs in some plastic bags full of groceries. Starts
               packing them away.

                                   TITUS   
                         How's school?

               Lindi tenses. She turns to face him. 

                                   LINDI  
                         Fine.
                             (beat)
                         Thanks.

               TITUS takes one of the grocery bags, starts unpacking.

                                   TITUS  
                         We'll organize a new group of
                         volunteers soon. I don't like you
                         missing school to help out here.

                                   LINDI  
                         I was free this morning.

                                   TITUS  
                         Then you should be studying.

               Lindi knows an argument's coming. She falls silent. Carries
               on packing things away. Titus lets it go and continues to why
               he's here.

                                   TITUS   (CONT'D)
                         I made a mistake about Tooth.

               Lindi pauses. Let this hang there for a beat. 

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         Kidy was here just now.
                             (beat, still hard for him)
                         She was lying.

               ON LINDI. Did she hear right?

                                   LINDI  
                         She's not pregnant?

               Titus shakes his head.

                                   TITUS  
                         No. She just wanted money.

               Lindi sobs. Everything that she's been through. The betrayal.
               The pain. The loss. All of it comes out. She chokes back the
               tears. Titus puts an arm on her shoulder. 

                                   TITUS (CONT'D)
                         Come home Lindi. Everything will be
                         just fine if you come home.

               Talk about bad timing. Lindi can't handle this right now. She
               walks out. OUT ON Titus. Troubled. Not sure what the next
               step is now.

                                       END ACT ONE

                                         ACT TWO



               INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

               On-air music plays in the background. MPHO, the hip, leather
               jacketed and faded jeans radio presenter, and TOOTH, are at
               the booth. TARYN is seated off mic, thumbs flying all over
               her phone. 

                                   TARYN
                         You owe me big time for this Tooth.
                         If you say anything dumb and I get
                         fired I swear I'll --

                                   TOOTH  
                         Auska-worry sis. Just make sure
                         everyone's listening.

                                   TARYN
                         And it looks like I'm doing what? 

                                   MPHO  
                         And we're back on in five--four--

               He mimes three--two--one. He cues up the mics.

                                   MPHO (CONT'D)
                             (into mic)
                         You're listening to the pulse of
                         Orlando East, keeping it real for
                         amajitas e'Ndofaya. We're back in
                         studio with artist Tooth, from the
                         kwaito duo Tooth and Nails.
                             (beat)
                         So Tooth. You told us how you were
                         busted pirating your own music and
                         how you had to do community service
                         for it. But the journey didn't end
                         there?

                                   TOOTH 
                             (into mic )
                         Sho Mpho, it didn't. I had the
                         chance to work with the best talent
                         ko- Youth Harvest. But then I
                         messed up again. Story of my life
                         mfowethu.



               EXT. CAR WASH - DAY

               LUNGI'S watching his car getting washed. The doors are open .
               The radio is on. 

                                   TOOTH
                             (on the radio)
                         I got greedy.
                         And I tried to take some short
                         cuts. And without realizing it I
                         ended up using my friends. 

               Lungi looks off. This resonates with him. 

                                   TOOTH (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
                             (on the radio)
                         It was a stupid plan.



               INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

                                   TOOTH
                             (into mic)
                         I recorded all the songs we were
                         prepping, and I was going to make
                         ama-cd and sell them undercover.
                         Mara I got busted ukugera. 

                                      MPHO
                         Caught red-handed. 

                                   TOOTH
                         Big time. Grand grand I deserved
                         it.



               INT. TARYN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY

               LINDI leaning on the counter, chewing a sandwich. Her
               cellphone is on, tuned into the radio station.

                                   TOOTH (V.O.)
                         But why I came on air is because I
                         want Remix, and all the guys ko
                         kasi and the whole world to hear me
                         say hade. I didn't mean to mess it
                         up for everyone. 

               Lindi hangs on every word he says.

                                   TOOTH (PRE-LAP)
                             (on the radio)
                         And majitas. If you're listening--



               INT. FANCY CAR - DAY

               THEMBI and NIKI are in NIKI'S CAR. Engulfed by shopping bags.
               Niki turns up the volume on the radio.

                                   TOOTH (V.O.)
                         --I'd just like to ask for a second
                         chance. Coz you guys are the best
                         people I've ever worked with.

               Niki and Thembi look at each other.  They make 'aaah' motions
               with their mouths. 

                                   TOOTH (PRE-LAP)
                             (on the radio)
                         And I know that--



               INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

                                   TOOTH
                             (into mic)
                         -- I don't deserve to have a team
                         like you guys. But if you can find
                         it in your hearts... to forgive me. 

               The silence hangs there for a beat. MPHO recovers.

                                   MPHO
                         Sho mfethu. And that's our AM drive
                         feature for today bafwethu.
                             (beat)
                         Let us know what you think. Should
                         Remix forgive Tooth and get back
                         together, or should they go their
                         separate ways. The number is three
                         four zero nine six. Smses charged
                         at one rand fifty. Three four zero
                         nine six. Let us know what you
                         think. 

               He cues up the music. As it fills the room--

                                   NAILS (PRE-LAP)
                         It's just like him.



               INT. PASTOR JEFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               PASTOR JEFF turns off his old school stereo. He looks up at
               SAM and NAILS.

                                   NAILS
                         Pulling a stunt like this.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                         Do not step on the crushed reed
                         Nails.

               OFF Nail's puzzled look.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  (CONT'D)
                         Your brother has stooped to
                         conquer. Do likewise.

               Pastor Jeff regards them for a beat, to let the message sink
               in. And leaves. Sam takes out his phone. It's a no brainer
               for him.

                                   SAM  
                             (rattling as he types)
                         Technically, if they didn't include
                         VAT in these SMS costs, we'd be
                         paying like one rand twenty. Plus
                         VAT it comes one rand thirty six
                         cents. But then they round it up
                         coz who's going to pay thirty six
                         cents?

               Nails isn't listening. He takes out his phone. Stares at it.
               It's a tough decision.



               INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

               MPHO stands and leaves TOOTH and TARYN alone. Taryn is
               impossible to read. 



               EXT. KING PIN'S WAREHOUSE (ESTABLISHING) - DAY

               We are outside a warehouse or godown of some sort.



               INT. KING PIN'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

               TWO WORKMEN, in BLUE OVERALLS, one in a BLUE CAP and another
               in a BEANIE, stacking up boxes. 

               PICK UP AND FOLLOW KING PIN as he walks past them, KIDY in
               tow.

                                   KING PIN   
                         What makes you think I'll pay for
                         it? 

                                   KIDY   
                         Coz you want it.
                             (beat, plaintive)
                         And I need the money.

                                   KING PIN  
                         All my money's tied up here Kidy. I
                         need to pay for more workers.

               Kidy pulls the file out of her bag.

                                   KIDY  
                         I'm cheap.

                                   KING PIN
                         I know.

               She hands him the file. King Pin glances over it casually.

                                   KIDY  
                         Two hundred. I can't go lower.

               King Pin's eyes pause. And linger for a second on something.
               His resumes his tone, even more nonchalant and dismissive.

                                   KING PIN  
                         There's nothing here I don't know
                         already. A clipper. Final offer.
                         Take it or leave it.

               Kidy snatches back the file. 

                                   KING PIN (CONT'D)  
                         What use is it to you?

               Kidy hesitates. King Pin grins. He knows he's got her.



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM - DAY

               LUNGI, TARYN, LINDI, NIKI, THEMBI, PASTOR JEFF AND TITUS face
               off with TOOTH and SAM.

                                   TARYN      
                         Three hundred and eleven people
                         voted. Only one was against.

               Titus coughs.

                                   NIKI
                         So we must just start afresh as if
                         you didn't try to rob us?

               Tooth rummages in his back-pack, takes out a CD.

                                   TOOTH   
                         This is it. This is everything. I
                         don't have another copy anywhere.
                         It's yours.

               They stare at the CD in his hands. No one moves. 

               Pastor Jeff steps forward and takes the CD.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         That takes guts Tooth. Thank you.

               He gives the CD over to Nails.

                                   PASTOR JEFF (CONT'D)
                         You have one week till the
                         regionals. If I were you, I'd stop
                         talking and start rehearsals
                         because we are competing for only
                         one spot at Nationals.

               The REMIX members trade glances. Lindi gives in.

                                   LINDI
                         Forgive and forget guys.

                                   TARYN 
                         This is your last chance Tooth.

               And with that the tension is lifted. They all unwind. Tooth
               eases - the storm is over.

                                   TOOTH
                         Okay then. Let's get started.
                         Nails? What do you have for us? I
                         was thinking maybe--

                                   KING PIN  
                             (O.S.)
                         Wow? So this is that Remix what
                         what, hey?

               They turn towards the entrance to see--

               KING PIN. Striding in. Like a boss.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         Brother Nkosi. It's been--  

                                   KING PIN  
                         A year. Been busy. Trying to keep
                         honest.
                             (for Tooth's benefit)
                         Unlike some people.

                                   TOOTH   
                         Hey wena. I just confessed on
                         radio. I don't have any more
                         secrets.

                                   KING PIN  
                         Then explain this.

               He holds up the file. 

                                   TITUS  
                         How did you get that?

               Titus looks around at the pairs of eyes asking him questions.

                                   KING PIN
                             (re: Tooth)
                         From his beloved girlfriend. You
                         need to be more careful who you let
                         into your office moruti.
                             (beat, ominously)
                         So, it seems that our boy here
                         hasn't completed his community
                         service.

                                   TOOTH  
                         That's a lie!

                                   KING PIN  
                         Check it yourself. That is your
                         hand writing Pastor?

               Titus glances at the file. Gulps hard. 

                                   KING PIN (CONT'D)  
                         While your friends were busy
                         working, you were running around
                         doing your own thing. 
                             (beat)
                         You've completed thirty five out of
                         fifty hours.

               ON Tooth. Sweating. A cornered animal. He senses what's
               coming. King Pin grabs the file back from Titus.

                                   KING PIN (CONT'D)  
                         According to --your file-- you were
                         supposed to finish your hours last
                         week otherwise...
                             (reads)
                         Criminal proceedings may be
                         initiated. 
                             (to Jeff and Titus,
                              threatening)
                         Why wasn't this reported? You were
                         accomplices in this. If the
                         department found out about this
                         they could shut down this whole
                         thing. Imagine the scandal.
                             (beat)
                         I don't know if the Praise and
                         Worship Competition board would 
                         want to be associated with a church
                         that's in the papers for all the
                         wrong reasons.

                                   PASTOR JEFF
                         What do you want?

               King Pin grins at Tooth.

                                   KING PIN   
                         I want my money and equipment back. 

                                   TOOTH
                         You can take the equipment. But I
                         don't have any money.

                                   KING PIN
                         Then you'll work for me. I need
                         workers at my warehouse. No pay.
                         You can work off the rest of your
                         hours there.

                                   TOOTH 
                         Work for you? Never.

                                   KING PIN  
                         Otherwise I go to the Department
                         and I go to the newspapers.
                             (beat)
                         I hope the Praise and Worship
                         people will let a church that's
                         being investigated compete. It will
                         do so much for their image.

               He eyes each of them in turn. The man is not kidding.

               ON Tooth. Mind spinning. He looks around the room. Looks at
               the effort. The sacrifices that have been made. He decides.
                                   END ACT TWO
                                    ACT THREE



               INT. KING PIN'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

               TOOTH, in blue overalls, stacks boxes inside the warehouse.
               KING PIN is seated some way off away from him. In a camping
               chair. Buried beneath a soccer magazine. Feet up. A beer at
               his side 

               Tooth takes one look at King Pin. He registers a mixture of
               despondency and disgust.

               His phone rings.

                                   VOICE (V.O.)
                         Tooth! Where the hell are you?

                                   TOOTH 
                             (harsh whisper into phone)
                         I just got held up but I'm --

                                   VOICE (V.O.)
                         I'm sick and tired of your stories
                         man. Vukani's not in today. Get
                         here in thirty minutes or else.

                                   TOOTH
                         I'll try.

                                   VOICE (V.O.)
                         What?

               King Pin looks up. Tooth turns away, shielding the phone.

                                   TOOTH
                         I said I'll do my best.

                                   VOICE (V.O.
                         You're best's not good enough.
                         You're fired. You hear me? F-A-Y-A
                         D.

               The line goes dead. Tooth stares at the phone.

                                   KING PIN
                         Hey! You! Back to work!

               Tooth breathes hard. Temper mounting. He swallows back his
               anger, picks up another box. This is bullshit.



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM - DAY

               REMIX are seated on the stage, each with a song sheet in
               hand. NAILS is facing them.

                                   NAILS  
                         So I guess the first thing we need
                         to decide is who's going to sing
                         lead.

               He looks around. No takers.

                                   NAILS (CONT'D)  
                         Lindi.

                                   LINDI  
                         I think Taryn should sing lead.

               And that takes everyone by surprise.

                                   TARYN  
                         What?

                                   LINDI  
                         You've worked so hard for this
                         sana. I can't take that away from
                         you. You sing lead.

               Taryn takes a second to understand this. She knows how much
               this means to Lindi. She blinks back tears. Lindi hugs her.

                                   TARYN  
                         Thanks friend.

                                   LINDI  
                         You deserve it sana.

                         Okay. So like this is awkward.

                         And I guess you'll sing lead?

               Nails regards Lungi for a second.

                         You will.

               Lungi is caught off guard. He didn't expect this.

                         You're the best tenor here Lungi.
                         This isn't about me. 

               There it is. Nails has done what is so hard for Lungi to do,
               to let someone else shine. Lungi nods. He's gotten the point.

                         Okay. We're supposed to prepare at

               INT. KING PIN'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

               TOOTH grabbing a stack of boxes. Tries to lift them off the
               ground. Too heavy. He tries again.

               BEANIE and BLUE CAP are sprawled some feet away, sipping
               mageus, bored.

               KING PIN walks in.

                                   KING PIN
                         Hey! There's been a dead dog
                         outside our gate for a week. Which
                         one you drunks ran over it.

                                   BLUE CAP
                         You know we don't drive moes.

                                   KING PIN
                         So you just left it there? You
                         don't care what customers will
                         think?

               Blue Cap and Beanie exchange a look. Nope. They don't.

                                   KING PIN  (CONT'D)
                         Get rid of it. It's stinking!

               Blue Cap and Beanie don't stir.

                                   BEANIE  
                         We're on break.

               King Pin zeroes in on Tooth.

                         Tooth. Get moving.

               Tooth can't believe his ears.

                                   TOOTH  
                         But these guys are just--

                         Move!

               Tooth drops the boxes and storms out, annoyed. King Pin
               follows. Blue Cap and Beanie snigger. They're enjoying this.



               INT. CHURCH AUDITORIUM - DAY

               We're at the tail end of a rehearsal.

                         That's our five.

               He looks at the faces starting back at him. Total dismay and
               disillusionment.

                         But actually Tooth missed a whole
                         ton of rehearsals.

                                   LINDI 
                         I also did. But that doesn't mean
                         that we must just go without him.

                                   LUNGI  
                         But the dude made his choice.

                         It was coz he didnt want to mess up
                         things for us Lungi.

                         I say we stay focused and we move
                         on. A whole lot of this was his
                         fault.

                             (beat)
                         Remix was Tooth's idea guys.

                         Thembi's right.

                         It doesn't matter if she's right.
                         Tooth's gone and we can't get him
                         back.

                         Let me guess. You want us to kidnap
                         him, and make him disappear until
                         the day of the competition.

               Nails's mind is elsewhere. Coming up with something.

                         like it, but it may get us Tooth
                         back.

               We are outside a theatre. The glass doors covered in posters.
               Upright roll-up banners stand on opposite sides of the door.

               "SA PRAISE AND WORSHIP REGIONAL QUALIFIERS".

               Faint applause and cheers emanate from within. We follow the
               sound to --



               INT. THEATRE - DAY

               The stage has been transformed from a bare theatrical space
               to a full-on "Idols-esque" band stand. Banners hang from the
               trusses. Multi-coloured lights play against the colorful
               backdrop.

               Even though the auditorium is only half-full of people
               (because these are qualifiers, not finals) they are making
               enough noise to fill a stadium. And they are cheering--

               A GROUP BOWING ON STAGE.

               We've caught the denoument of their performance. 

               The PRESENTER, TUMI, a gorgeous woman in a breathtaking
               dress, prances in stage left.

                                   TUMI
                         Ladies and gents, give it up for

               She turns to the GROUP LEADER, a young man (mid-twenties) in
               an oversized suit.

                                   PRESENTER
                         Tell us, what inspired your song
                         choice.

                                   GROUP LEADER
                             (nervous)
                         Well, Tumi. We were inspired by
                         having gone through betrayals by
                         people that we love, and then we
                         realized that the Lord Jesus is the
                         one person who'll never betray us.

                                   TUMI
                         Wow! And I felt it coming through
                         your performance. Judges, what's
                         your take?

               For the first time we notice a raised dais at the centre of
               the front row, where the THREE JUDGES sit. A middle aged
               black hipster - ANDILE, a black, OLD SCHOOL guy in a suit,
               BRA ZAKES, and a forty-ish black woman -- BUSI -- who would
               come across as attractive if she wasn't so stern.

                         For me personally. I could see you
                         guys have rehearsed. You've put a
                         lot of time and work into your

               INT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE - DAY

               A GROUP comprising of six youthful artistes, THREE GUYS and
               THREE GIRLS, stand waiting on the wings. Ready. They show a
               sense of calm poise and preparedness. Professional. They are--

               ANOINTED VOCALS (our faithful viewers will remember them from
               Episode one). 

               LUNGI, TARYN, LINDI, THEMBI, NIKI, NAILS AND TOOTH are
               watching them from further down the corridor.

                                   NIKI   
                         They think they're all that.

                                   THEMBI  
                         With a tenor like that guy, so
                         would I chomi.

                                   SOPRANO DIVA  
                         Excuse me.

               SOPRANO DIVA (from Episode one) pushes past them. FOLLOW her
               as she squeezes past the REMIX members, and stay on their
               stupefied faces.

                                   NAILS   
                         Yaasas, how can they allow her to
                         sing?

               SAM rapidly crosses himself.

                                   NIKI  
                         Chill bhuti. If she's all that, why
                         would she be singing with a small
                         group.

                                   LUNGI  
                         Anointed Vocals ain't small guys.

                                   TARYN  
                         Shut up, they're going on stage.

               They look on as--

                                   TUMI (O.S.)
                         Please welcome to the stage--
                             (beat, razzmatazz)
                         Anointed Vocals.

               Muted applause filters in. The REMIX members register
               despair.

                                   THEMBI   
                         Yo, bathong. We're going in after
                         them.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         If you think positive, you'll be
                         positive.

               They wheel around to find--

                                   PASTOR JEFF   (CONT'D)
                         Sorry I'm late. Came back here to
                         wish you all good luck.

                                   LINDI  
                         Did my--

               Jeff's eyes answer her question. He feels the need to soften
               the blow.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         He said to wish you good luck. He
                         got held up at Church and--

                                   TARYN   
                         Hush...

               Jeff wraps a supporting arm around Lindi's shoulder. At least
               he came, right?

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. THEATRE STAGE - DAY

               ANOINTED VOCALS is lined up on the stage. 

               The lights dim. Spotlights focus on the LEAD TENOR and the
               SOPRANO DIVA.

               Lead Tenor opens on a soulful, powerful note. Soprano Diva
               blends in. It's ovewhelming and uplifting.

               And just when we think this is going to be a two-person show--

               The rest of Anointed Vocals JOINS in. It's only seven of them
               on stage, but man, can they sing. The harmony is other
               worldly. Their slow, rhythmic dancing is solemn and moving. 

               Soprano Diva sings a solo verse that climaxes in a piercing
               high note. The audience is eating out of her hands by now.

               And they end the song. 

               They're too cool to bow. It's obvious that they have set the
               bar high, and whoever comes next is in some serious trouble. 

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE - DAY

               Disbelief on the faces of REMIX.

                                   NIKI  
                         Shit.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         In these circumstances, Nikiwe.
                         I'll let you get away with that.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Chila bafwethu. We can do this. 

                                   NAILS  
                         Let's start with Joko Ea Hao.

               Tooth regards Nails for a second. This is an inversion of
               roles. Tooth senses what he has to do. 

                                   TOOTH   
                         Good idea. Everyone ready?

               Nods.

                                   TUMI (O.S.)
                         Let's welcome onto the stage
                             (beat)
                         Remix...

                                   THEMBI  
                         Lungi, relax. Deep breath. 

                                   LUNGI  
                         Deep breath? Ain't nobody got time
                         for that. Let's go.

               They stride out onto the stage, masking their fear and lack
               of confidence in a false assuredness.



               INT. THEATRE STAGE - DAY

               REMIX stands assembled on stage. TOOTH takes a step forward,
               bows to the judges and whips around to face his team.

               He gives Taryn a reassuring nod and --

               TARYN LEADS THEM IN THEIR PERFORMANCE of "Joko Ea Hao".

               It's upbeat and funky. An unexpected take on an old school
               classic.

               Within moments, the crowd is swaying from side to side,
               enjoying the singing, the dancing, the entire spectacle of a
               well-jacked musical machine.

               Giving them something new.

               PAN across the faces of the Remix members, enjoying
               themselves. Embracing the satisfaction of knowing that this
               is a job well done.

               They wind up their performance in a soft decrescendo.
               Stylish. Very stylish.

               The audience BREAKS into rupturous applause. Settle on the
               beaming faces of our singers. Their confidence is restored.
               They'd better be going through to the next round because now--

               THEY FINALLY BELIEVE THEY CAN DO THIS. 

               TUMI waltzes in from the wings.

                                   TUMI
                         I think there won't be much debate
                         about that performance, right?

               A chorus of "No's" and cheers from the crowd.

                                   TUMI  (CONT'D)
                         Judges? What do you have to say?

                                   ANDILE 
                         That was totally unexpected. I'm
                         totally blown away. 

                                   BUSI   
                         It's not often that one sees such a
                         level of creativity and spontaneity
                         in a performance. Well done, all of
                         you.

               The REMIX members exchange smiles. They're through!

                                   BRA ZAKES   
                         I'd just like to add something.

               The tone of his voice warns them that there's a storm-a
               coming.

                                   BRA ZAKES  (CONT'D)
                         Even though you guys are very
                         professional. And very polished. It
                         seems clear to me that you are not
                         quite there yet.

               Beat. The Remix member's don't quite know what to make of
               this. Bra Zakes continues off Tooth's quizzical gaze.

                                   BRA ZAKES   (CONT'D)
                         Praise and Worship isn't just about
                         singing and dancing. It's got to
                         come from inside. From your life of
                         faith and prayer. Otherwise it
                         would just be a concert.

               Gulp! They didn't see that one coming. And they've got no
               comeback whatsover. Bra Zakes has seen through what they
               themselves had never realized.

                                   BRA ZAKES  (CONT'D)
                         So even though you're through to
                         the next round, I'd have to ask you
                         guys to really dig deep and give us
                         something we can believe. Thank
                         you.

               That hangs there for a beat before Remix are jolted back to
               reality by--

                                   TUMI  
                         Let's welcome onto the stage with a
                         warm round of applause Gospel
                         Adrenaline!

               And Tooth hurries off the stage, followed by his teammates. 
                                   END ACT THREE

                                     ACT FOUR



               INT. BACKSTAGE REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

               The REMIX members congregate in the green room.

                                   SAM  
                         See? I told you guys to come to
                         church.

                                   NIKI  
                         Duh. Like we've been somewhere else
                         every afternoon for the last month?

               Lungi sits in a corner.

                                   LUNGI  
                         I can't believe this. I've come too
                         far for this.

                                   LINDI  
                         We've all come too far for this.

               PASTOR JEFF walks in.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         Idle words will get you nowhere.
                             (beat, continues)
                         You need to humble yourselves, go
                         down on your knees and pray.   

                                   LUNGI  
                         These are new Levis.

               Jeff ignores him.

                                   PASTOR JEFF   
                         Who do you think gave you your
                         ability to sing?

                                     SAM
                         Well, genetically speaking, it came
                         from--

               Taryn gives him a sharp poke in the ribs. Shut up!

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         You all got your talents from
                         above. And to whom much is given,
                         much will be demanded of.

               Beat. The mood is pensive as they process this sentiment that
               they had forgotten about along the way.

                                   PASTOR JEFF (CONT'D) 
                         And that's what the judges want.
                         They want you all to look deep
                         inside your hearts and remember the
                         real reason for praise and worship.
                             (beat)
                         And it's got nothing to do with
                         trophies and competitions.

               The message hits home. Silence for a beat until--

                                   NAILS   
                         Tooth, mfowethu. You should lead us
                         in a word of prayer.

               Tooth looks up, surprised. Why him?

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         I think so too.

                                   TARYN  
                         But not like last time man, please.

               Tooth weighs this. He searches for the words. Sees the eyes
               focused on him.  

                                   TOOTH  
                         Let us pray.

               He clears his throat. Everyone bows their heads.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)   
                         Modimo. In the book of Genesis you
                         said you created human beings to
                         work.

               Stares of surprise and shock all around. CLOSE ON Lindi. She
               can't believe Tooth reads the Bible. Tooth continues,
               immersed in the realness of the moment.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)  
                         Modimo. This is our span here. And
                         we want to do it well. For your
                         glory.
                             (beat, about to continue
                              but)
                         Amen.

               A chorus of hesitant "Amens" from the other.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         Amen.
                             (beat, grins)
                         I have to say, that's the best damn
                         prayer I've ever heard in my life.

                                   SAM  
                         Moruti! You cursed.

               Jeff doesn't care. He gives Tooth a fatherly pat on the back.
               The young man has finally got it. 

               OUT on Tooth. Serious. Thoughtful. A moment of epiphany as he
               finally understands his purpose in life. A hand links up with
               his. 

               He looks up to find Lindi smiling at him. 



               INT. THEATRE STAGE - DAY

               MONTAGE

               QUICK CUTS between different groups singing on stage.

               -- Trios. Quartets. Quintets.

               -- REMIX performing. They're ROCKING the stage.

               -- THE JUDGES. Beaming. Giving them nods of approval. 

               --REMIX. Singing like they mean it. Like it's coming from
               within.

               --APPLAUSE. The audience is on its feet. 

               --REMIX beam their thanks and walk off stage as TUMI confers
               with the judges.

                                                                CUT TO:
               INT. THEATRE STAGE - DAY

               TUMI catwalks onto the stage.  

               CLOSE on REMIX seated in the middle rows, on the edge of
               their seats. In the row behind them, ANOINTED VOCALS. This is
               it. The moment of judgement.

               ON Tumi. On the stage.

                                   TUMI   
                         On behalf of the National Praise
                         and Worship competition team, the
                         judges and our sponsors, we'd like
                         to thank all the groups that have
                         given us such a spectacular
                         performance today.

               WHOOPS and YELLS from the house. Someone screams "TUMI we
               love you." Tumi laughs it off. Yes, she gets this all the
               time.

                                   TUMI (CONT'D)  
                         And now, the final scores. After
                         the round competition, the two
                         teams that will compete for the one
                         spot in the National finals will be
                         decided by a simple tally of
                         points.

               She pulls out a paper. The audience grows silent. Air
               dripping with expectation.

               She unfolds the paper.

                                   TUMI (CONT'D)   
                         In eighth position. With twenty
                         points.
                             (beat)
                         Zion Melody.

               ARRGH! The ZION MELODY team is not at all impressed. 

                                   TUMI
                         Seventh. With twenty eight points.
                         Heavenly Cadence. Sixth. With
                         thirty four points. Prophecy. In
                         fifth position. With thirty nine
                         points. Joyful Noise.
                             (beat)
                         Fourth. With forty two points. 
                              (beat, wait for it)
                         Newborn.

               REMIX and ANOINTED VOCALS stir in excitement. The finish line
               is close. 

               LINDI starts a hand-holding-chain in the row. 

               ON TUMI.

                                   TUMI   
                         Third. With forty four points.
                              (beat, keeps them waiting
                              for it)
                         Third. Is. Choirs of Angels.

               REMIX leap out of their seats with screams of delight. Hugs.
               Pats on the back. Tears. 

               They're through to the finals.

               ANOINTED VOCALS behind them exchange cordial handshakes and
               warm smiles. They'd been expecting this. They're so smug it
               hurts.

               CHOIRS OF ANGELS give each other sad embraces and nods. At
               least they came third.

               ON TUMI. Eyes widening.

                                   TUMI (CONT'D)  
                         But...But..in a totally unexpected
                         result.

               REMIX quieten down. What now?

                                   TUMI (CONT'D)   
                         Anointed Vocals comes second with
                         forty five points. And 
                              (screaming)
                         New Kids on the block - Remix -
                         come first with forty six points.
                         It's Remix and Anointed Vocals to
                         battle it out for the single spot
                         in the National Competition.

               CLOSE ON Anointed Vocals. Confused. Did they hear that right?

               ON REMIX. In silent disbelief.

                                   TITUS  
                         I knew you would beat them.

               TITUS comes up behind them.

                                   LINDI  
                         Papa.

               He gives Lindi a hug. Lindi springs into his hands --a little
               girl.

                                   LINDI  
                         Moruti Jeff said you were too busy
                         to--

                                   TITUS  
                         I'm never too busy for my girl.

                                   LINDI  
                         You were here all the time?

                                   TITUS  
                         I never missed a single song.
                              (beat, quiet)
                         You sounded just like your mother.

               And for the first time in a long while Lindi smiles at her
               father.

                                   TITUS  
                         I'm sorry. For everything.

               She hugs him tighter. The gap between father and daughter has
               been bridged. All is forgiven. 

               The REMIX members look on, respecting the intimacy of moment.



               INT. BACKSTAGE REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

               And we're back in the rehearsal room.

                                   LUNGI
                         I've got it. "Yahweh". 

                                   TARYN  
                         You only want to sing that because
                         of the solo at the end.

                                   LUNGI  
                         Yeah. So?

               TARYN levels him with her stare. How can he be so selfish at  
               a time like this?

                                   NIKI  
                         We could do "Rivers of Zion".

                                   THEMBI  
                         That's a great idea, choma. We
                         could add that dance we did to
                         spice it up nyana.

               She demonstrates.

                                   NAILS   
                         Thembi, we are performing in front
                         of morutis.

                                   THEMBI  
                         Yeah. So? They're men...

               TOOTH looks up.

                                   TOOTH  
                         We're going to sing "Praise Him."

               Nails face lights up.

                                   NAILS  
                         We'll nail "Praise Him."

                                   TOOTH  
                         You remember the dance moves right?

               NIKI nods, illustrates the simple moves.

                                   NIKI  
                         One two. Turn turn. Step back.
                         Forward. Turn.

               THEMBI and LINDI join in.

                                   TARYN   
                         There's only one problem.

               They turn to face her. What now?

                                   TARYN (CONT'D)  
                         I only sang that song once,
                         remember guys?

                                   SAM  
                         Yes. With Rebecca.

               Now this is a whole new problem that they hadn't thought
               about. Silence for a beat.

                                   TARYN 
                             (re: Lindi)
                         But Lindi knows that song in her
                         sleep.

               She nods at Lindi. Lindi is caught unawares.

                                   LINDI  
                         But--you're lead.

                                   TARYN  
                         You gave me a chance, chomie,
                         remember? Now it's my turn.

               Lindi takes a moment to consider this. All the eyes around
               the room are wishing her to do it. She breaks into a smile.
               Humbled. Tooth is reinvigorated.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Okay. That's settled. Majitas, are
                         we ready to do this?

               He moves to the middle of the room. Stretches out his hand.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Remix. On three.

               The rest gather round him, join hands for a group shake.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         One two three...

               All together now-- "REMIX".

                                   SAM  
                         Let's make it stink!

               Taryn claps him over the head. 

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. THEATRE STAGE - DAY

               ANOINTED VOCALS on the stage. 

               The auditorium is silent. Lights are dimmed.

               PAN ACROSS the taut faces of the REMIX members, watching from
               the wings. The strain is palpable.

                                   TARYN  
                         Why do the flippin judges always
                         let them go first?

                                   LINDI  
                         Saving the best for last sana.

                                   LUNGI  
                         Hush. I'm trying to focus here.

                                   TARYN  
                         Go hush yourself. 

               The music is cued up. 

               And ANOINTED VOCALS begin their final performance.

               They sing "I Belong To You". It's poignant piece with the
               moving sentimentality of a negro spiritual.

               The audience is wrapped in silence. Soaking in the emotion. 

               ANOINTED VOCALS are good. And THEY KNOW IT. Their calm
               confidence seems to almost be nailing home the point that
               they deserve that one place in the National Finals. 

               ON REMIX.

               They're in awe. Overwhelmed by what they are listening to. 

               Cadence brought out their big guns. And they fire straight
               through to the end.

               The CROWD BRINGS DOWN THE HOUSE with their applause.

               BACK ON REMIX.

               Daunted.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Let's go.

               FOLLOW Remix as they walk their way to the stage. Taking in
               the challenge and responding with all the professional focus
               they can muster. Filtering out TUMI welcoming them onto
               stage. Blocking out the yells of the crowd. Pushing aside
               their own fears.

               Because THIS IS IT.

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. THEATRE STAGE - DAY

               REMIX assembled on the stage. 

               Tooth bows to the house. Turns around, arms uplifted. Ready
               to make magic happen.

               ON LINDI.

               Her eyes are trained on--

               THE THEATRE DOORS.

               A WELL DRESSED MAN stands there, looking around for a seat.
               It's PERCY.

               ON LINDI

               She gulps. The music is cued. 

               Nothing from Lindi.

               TOOTH clears his throat, tries to get her attention. Lindi's
               eyes are frozen on the door.

               CLOSE ON THE WELL DRESSED MAN.

               As he finds a seat and takes it. Settles down and looks up.
               It's PERCY.

               BACK ON LINDI

               Frozen.

                                   TOOTH   
                             (harsh whisper)
                         Lindi.

               Everyone looks at her. Expectation is mounting.

               ON TITUS, looking on. Concern on his face. Desperately
               wanting Lindi to snap out of whatever the hell it is she
               needs to snap out of.

               ON LINDI. Apprehension evolves into a full on panic attack.

               SHE RUNS OFF STAGE.

               A wave of murmurs from the audience. TOOTH whips around to
               face the judges.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Hade. I mean, sorry. We need a
                         minute. It's er--something she ate.

               He gives them his million dollar smile.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                             (sotto voce, to REMIX)
                         Stay here.

               And he bolts out after Lindi. 

               The REMIX members trade embarrassed looks. 



               INT. BACKSTAGE ROOM - DAY  

               LINDI rocking back and forth in a chair. Bundle of nerves.
               TOOTH is beside her. The look on his face says it all. She's
               come clean.

                                   LINDI  
                         I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

                                   TOOTH  
                         You didn't want to tell me this
                         before?

                                   LINDI  
                         I tried but-- I'm so sorry.

                                   TOOTH
                             (looks off, anger
                              mounting)
                         Son of a--

               Tooth paces. The things he'll do to Percy when he gets his
               hands on -- He realizes their situation. This is neither the
               time nor the place.

               He gets a hold of himself. Approaches Lindi, crouches beside
               her. Close. Intimate.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Listen to me Lindi. I want to kill
                         that guy right now. But he's not
                         important. You are. 

                                   LINDI  
                         I can't.

                                   TOOTH  
                         I need you to find that strength
                         you found that night at the
                         shebeen. 

               Lindi takes a moment.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Okay?

               She cracks.

                                   LINDI  
                         That was different Tooth. Now there
                         are so many eyes. Just waiting for
                         me to fail.

               Tooth takes her hands in his.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Lindi. Nine nine you are the best
                         soprano I've ever heard. Why do you
                         think Taryn let you sing the solo
                         in the final?

               Beat. Lindi's uncertainties lined across her face.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Those people out there want to hear
                         you sing. We want to hear you sing.
                         And you want to hear you sing.
                             (beat)
                         Dammit, the whole world wants to
                         hear you sing. So go out there and
                         give it everything you've got.
                             (beat)
                         Because that's you. That's the
                         woman I love.

               She looks into his eyes and sees the truth there. Calm.
               Reassuring. She holds him tight, pulls back from the hug.
               Transformed. Her eyes lit up. 

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. THEATRE STAGE - DAY

               CLOSE ON Lindi's intense eyes.

               PULL OUT to reveal--

               Lindi on stage. Looking at the crowd. Brimming with
               confidence. 

               TOOTH raises his arms with finality.

               And Lindi BREAKS FORTH into a solo that would put Whitney
               Houston (may her soul rest in peace) and all the divas that
               came after her to shame.

               And as the remixed groovy beats of "Praise Him" rock the
               theatre.

               The REMIX members sing and dance their hearts out.

               It's a start contrast to the preceding performance. They are
               lively, jovial. Funky. 

               They're kicking it. And enjoying every moment.

               The house is ON IT'S FEET. Moving to the music. Remix rocking
               this crowd as only the best house DJs could.

               And right at the climax of their well-timed, perfectly
               harmonized spectacle--

               The tempo drops back to the soulful, slow opening. Lindi hits
               every closing note of the final lines with a raw perfection
               that makes them come alive with emotion. The audience is
               hushed, wondering how such a small body can make such a
               powerful, mature and rich tone. 

               And so do we.

               Her final note lingers in the air. 

               Everyone remains in their seat. And we are also left
               wondering whether or not this has come to an end. Because the
               truth is--

               We don't want it to. WE WANT IT TO CONTINUE FOREVER.

               A sound breaks the still magic of the auditorium.

               CLAP-- CLAP-- CLAP.

               ON TITUS, rising to his feet with a slow clap. Jeff, beside
               him, does likewise. So too the people beside them.

               And in a few seconds, like a wildfire sweeping through Table
               Mountain, a hurricane of astonished applause takes the
               audience by storm and doesn't let them go what feels like a
               good minute. 

               THIS IS MOVING ladies and gentlemen. 

               This is Praise and Worship as it's meant to be.

               OUT on the beaming faces of REMIX. Close on LINDI. Close on
               Tooth. Seventh heaven.  

               ON TUMI.

               Strutting onto the stage.

                                   TUMI  
                         Thank you. Thank you for two
                         wonderful performances.
                             (beat)
                         They've brought it down to the
                         wire. I'd hate to have to be one of
                         the judges right now.

               The crowd quietens down. Anticipation mounting. Tumi turns to
               the judges.

                                   TUMI  (CONT'D)
                         Judges. Their fates are in your
                         hands. Which of these two groups,
                         will represent Gauteng in the
                         National Praise and Worship Finals? 

               Beat. The judges exchange looks.

                                   TUMI (CONT'D)
                         Your votes please.

               ANDILE stirs, clears his throat.

                                   ANDILE  
                         Mina. I was quite impressed by
                         Anointed Vocals. They were tight.
                         They were professional. But in
                         terms of taking me where I wanted
                         to go--
                             (beat, deep breath)
                         I'll have to go with Remix.

               TARYN screams and hugs Sam. Remix are tingling with
               excitement. Anointed Vocals look on in determined silence.
               It's not over yet.

                                   TUMI  
                         Busi?

                                   BUSI  
                         Well Tumi. Personally. I feel that
                         both groups came here with a clear
                         agenda to get into the finals. They
                         both put their hearts and souls
                         into it, and if I could have two
                         teams going through to Nationals
                         I'd vote for them both.
                             (beat)
                         But since I can't. I'd have to go
                         with--
                             (beat)
                         Anointed Vocals.

               A SHRILL CHEER from Soprano Diva. The Anointed Vocal members
               high five each other.

                                   TUMI
                         This is a true photo finish. Bra
                         Zakes. It's up to you now. Who's
                         going to go through to the National
                         Finals?

               ZAKES is quiet. His mind is crunching away. He looks at
               Anointed. Looks at Remix. Back at Anointed. Back at Remix.

               Tooth bows his head, awaiting the verdict that will determine
               whether all his efforts come to fruition or to naught.

               And with that we--
                                   END ACT FOUR
                                     ACT FOUR



               INT. THEATRE STAGE - DAY

               ON TOOTH's anxious face. Eyes trained -- 

               ON BRA ZAKES. He takes a deep breath.

                                   BRA ZAKES  
                         You've both worked so hard. It
                         kills me to have to disappoint one
                         of you. 
                             (beat)
                         But for me, neh, the main thing is 
                         - what do I think mzansi wants to
                         hear?
                             (beat)
                         And I'd have to say its-- ANOINTED
                         VOC--

               AAAAARRRRHHH! ANOINTED VOCALS go ape-shit. They're flipping
               out. Screams. Shouts. Joy. Tears. Hugs. And relief.

               ON REMIX. Deflated. Incarnating the agony of deafeat. 

               TOOTH goes over to the LEAD TENOR and shakes his hand. Nails
               follows suit, and in an instant, they're all exchanging
               congratulatory hand shakes. The small gesture that keeps
               REMIX's dignity intact.

                                   BRA ZAKES  (CONT'D)
                         I'm not done yet.

               What was that? They all spin around to face Zakes, in wrapt
               attention.

                                   BRA ZAKES  (CONT'D)
                         Remix aren't through to Nationals,
                         but you deserve a special mention
                         for giving mzansi something it's
                         never heard before. Thank you.

               Tooth steps forward, takes the mic from TUMI.

                                   BRA ZAKES  (CONT'D)
                         Thank you. Mara the guy who deserve
                         the praise is my auti here. Nails.

               The REMIX members shout and whoop. Giving Nails the acclaim
               he so rightly deserves. 

               And Nails is actually blushing.

                                   NIKI  
                         You deserve it bhuti.

               She pulls him into a tight hug. Tooth pats Nails shoulder.
               Lead Tenor wanders over.

                                   LEAD TENOR  
                         I hate to say it but -- you guys
                         deserved to win.

               Tooth smiles his thanks. 

               ON Lungi and Sam, sharing a look of mutual understanding.

               They grab Nails and hoist him shoulder high. The girls YELL.
               They carry him off the stage in a mini-procession.

               The house crowds around them, patting their backs, whistling,
               whooping. It's like "Rocky" without the "Adrian!"

               TUMI is on stage trying to say something but getting drowned
               out by the cheers of the fans squeezed around REMIX.

               Bra Zakes works his way through the crowd. He reaches out to
               Nails, business card in hand.

                                   BRA ZAKES  
                         Here's my card. Call me.

               Nails takes the offered card, mouths his thanks. 

               OFF his radiant face. 



               EXT. CHURCH - DAY

               Braai smoke wafts through the air. Music blaring. TOOTH and
               NAILS working the decks. TITUS, in a kiss-the-chef apron,
               turns some chicken over on a sizzling BRAAI STAND. LINDI, his
               lovely assistant, takes a full tray, playing the waitress.

               In the middle of the yard, the REMIX members are kicking it.
               LUNGI dances with THEMBI. SAM with TARYN. 

               And ELMARIE VAN ZYL is busting some awkward moves with BISHOP
               ZERUBBABEL PHAKATI. It looks like they're both cult fans of
               Grease.

               The Bishop dances over to Tooth and Nails.

                                   BISHOP PHAKATI  
                         So I hear you boys are very
                         talented.

                                   TOOTH  
                         It's what they say ko strateng.

                                   BISHOP PHAKATI
                             (to Tooth )
                         We've been looking for sometime now
                         for some one to teach music to the
                         other praise teams in the diocese.
                         It's a lot of work. Full time. You
                         interested?

               Tooth trades looks with Nails. We can see -- he's not leaving
               his boy behind.

                                   TOOTH 
                         Sounds like too much work for one
                         man. 

               The Bishop gets his drift. Glances at Nails.

                                   BISHOP PHAKATI  
                         I'm sure we can work something out.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Then you've found yourself some
                         music teachers moruti.

                                   BISHOP PHAKATI  
                         Amen to that. Let's speak about it
                         on Monday. For now, enjoy!

               He dances off. Tooth and Nails are dumbfounded. They've just
               gotten their first official jobs in real life. Nails pats his
               back.

                                   NAILS  
                         We're now employed son.

               Tooth is staggered.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Oh my God. I can afford to pay rent
                         now. 
                             (beat)
                         I need a drink. 

               ON PASTOR JEFF as he mans the cooler box. TOOTH wanders over
               to him.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Ekse ntate. Kikela ispinza. 

               JEFF gives him the beady eye. Tooth ought to know better. He
               rummages within the cooler box.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         Cool drinks only. Grapetiser.
                         Orange juice. Coke.

                                   TOOTH  
                             (pointing)
                         Hau! And the zamalek?

               Tooth pulls out a dumpie from the cooler box. Jeff reels -
               how on earth did that get in there?

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                             (winks)
                         Sharp bhoza. 

               And he takes off, dumpie in hand, before Jeff can recover
               from the shock. Tooth shoots a sly look at--

               NAILS. Grinning. At his feet, four or five more dumpies. They
               trade a thumbs up. 

                                   NIKI  
                         Hey bhuti. Wanna dance?

                                   NAILS  
                         Er-- sho. Mara I'm busy deejaying
                         and--

                                   NIKI  
                         Ow come on.

               She drags him away from the deck and onto the "dance floor."

               She makes a clumsy effort at sbujwa. It's everything Nails
               can do to keep from laughing, but he joins in wholeheartedly,
               the bond between these two growing.

               ON TOOTH. Shaking his head in disbelief.

                                   LINDI  
                         IKuku?

               Tooth snaps around to find LINDI holding out a tray laden
               with chicken. Off his is confusion around the double-meaning.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Sho. I mean--no. I mean--
                             (beat)
                         Sho. Thanks.

               He picks a piece. Lindi smiles at him, lingers for a beat. 

               The music changes from a house groove to a slow R&B song.
               Tooth sees an opening.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                             (flawless Xhosa)
                         Ungathanda ukudansa?

               Lindi falters. Looks at the tray. Tooth registers Lungi and
               Thembi are dancing close by. He taps Lungi's shoulder.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Ekse Lungstar.

               Lungi jerks around -- Tooth grabs the tray and dumps it in
               his hands.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Sho bafwethu.

                                   LUNGI  
                         Hey! What the--

               But Tooth's already swept Lindi away in his arms, slow
               dancing across the yard.

                                   THEMBI  
                         Sho. Thanks. I was starving.

               She picks a piece off the tray. And we leave Lungi looking
               put out and --

               SETTLE ON TITUS. Scowling. Watching Tooth and Lindi as they
               slow dance together.

               CLOSE ON TOOTH AND LINDI. The sexual tension between these
               two is heavy.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Listen. I've been meaning to--

                                   LINDI  
                         I know.

               Tooth gazes at her. Questions in his eyes. And in our minds.
               Fortunately Lindi fills us in.

                                   LINDI  (CONT'D)
                         I don't know if I'm ready to get
                         into something again right now,
                         Tooth.

               Tooth face falls. But he smiles and nods. A true gentleman.
               She sees his pain, offers him a ray of hope--

                                   LINDI  (CONT'D)
                         But if you can wait--

                                   TOOTH  
                             (I'm serious about you)
                         I'll wait.

               She searches his eyes, and finds the confirmation she seeks
               there. He means it. She returns his smile, leans in and
               kisses him on the cheek.

               She pulls away and leaves. Tooth watches her go, renewed
               resolution all over his face.

               The woman has just walked away with his heart. But this time
               we know he'll wait for her.

               He turns to watch Nails and Niki. Dancing away. A nostalgic,
               longing in his eyes. Wondering why he couldn't be that lucky
               with love.

               BZZZZZZ! Feedback from the microphone breaks the moment.

               ANGLE ON PASTOR JEFF, on the DJ Decks.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         How do you turn off this thing.

               Nails rushes to his assistance, turns down the music.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  (CONT'D)
                             (beat, into mic)
                         Ahem. I just thought I'd say a few
                         words--

               GROANS and MOANS from the small crowd. 

                                   PASTOR JEFF  (CONT'D)
                             (quickly)
                         It'll be brief. Brevity is the soul
                         of wit, heh heh--
                             (beat, off their deadpan
                              stares)
                         Okay. Okay. Firstly I want to thank 
                         Bishop Phakhati and Miss Van Zyl
                         for joining us.

                                   THEMBI  
                         Ayoba!

                                   NAILS  
                         Woop woop!

                                   PASTOR JEFF  
                         Yes. And I would also like to thank
                         Pastor Titus. For being the best
                         right hand man I could ever wish
                         for.

               Someone whistles in the crowd. ON TITUS. Abashed. Not used to
               the attention.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  (CONT'D)
                         And I'd like to thank Remix. For
                         putting Youth Harvest back on the
                         map. And even though we didn't make
                         it to the finals--mzansi now knows
                             (beat)
                         That we are coming!

               Yells and shrieks cut him off. Jeff grins. Finds Titus by the
               braai stand.

                                   PASTOR JEFF  (CONT'D)
                         Titus. Please. A word.

               He offers him the mic. 

               ON TITUS. Hesitant.

               Tooth starts a slow chant.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Titus--Titus--

               The other join in. "Titus--Titus--Titus."

               CLOSE on Lindi. Radiant. Chanting with the rest. 

               Titus shrugs -- Okay. Fine. Whatever. Pulls off his apron and
               makes his way to the DJ deck amidst raucous cheering.

                                   TITUS  
                         Thank you.
                             (beat, matter-of-fact)
                         Firstly I want to thank Bishop
                         Phakati for --

                                   BISHOP PHAKATI
                             (yells)
                         Protocol has already been observed
                         Pastor. lol!

               Laughter from the crowd. Titus smiles. Continues.

                                   TITUS  
                         Yes. Alright.
                             (beat, weighing his words)
                         I remember that first day when I
                         met Tooth, Thembi, Nails and Niki.
                         We got off to a bumpy start--

                                   THEMBI
                             (yells)
                         Sorry?

               More laughter..

                                   TITUS
                             (forcing himself to be
                              serious )
                         But over the past two months, I've
                         come to learn a lot from you --
                         guys. And I'd like to thank you all
                         -
                             (beat, looks at Lindi)
                         For everything you've taught me.
                             (beat)
                         Ndiyabulela.

               He puts down the mic and walks off the stage. Tooth raises a 
               round of clapping. The others follow suit. Heartfelt and
               warm.

               They thought they'd never see the human side of Titus.

               Tooth moves to the stage, picks up the mic.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Ey guys. I want to say a big thank
                         you to -- Sam. 

               ON Sam. Pleasantly surprised.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Thanks for keeping us on the
                         straight and narrow.

               Sam blushes. Taryn smiles at him, gives him a playful shove.

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                             (off Taryn's smile)
                         And Taryn. You always kept us
                         thinking straight.

                                   TARYN   
                         Next time I want pay.

               Chuckles from the crowd.

                                   TOOTH  
                         Niki. Thanks for helping us see
                         things from -- your -- from the
                         other side.

               Niki smiles, doubtful of the compliment.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Lungi. You kept us looking good.

               Lungi straightens his sports coat. You're damn right.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Thembi. 
                             (beat, off her expectant
                              look)
                         Well. Thanks for being--you.

               And that's good enough for her. She beams her gratitude.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Lindi. 
                             (beat, searching for the
                              words)
                         That strength you found inside. It
                         inspired us all.

               TITUS wraps an arm around Lindi. She also inspired him.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         And lastly. To the heart and soul
                         of Remix. The man who made all of
                         tis possible. 

               He looks at his friend. His boy. His brother.

                                   TOOTH  (CONT'D)
                         Nails!

               And that just does it. Their acclamation is definitive. And
               deafening. Nails is confused and overwhelmed and embarrassed 
               at the same time.

               ON TOOTH. 

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         Before the last get down. Moruti
                         Jeff and Titus. We have something
                         special for you.

               He nods to the rest of REMIX. They assemble next to him. 

                                   TOOTH (CONT'D)
                         This one is a special one. It's not
                         for any competition or anything.
                         It's to say thank you to the
                         Bishop, to the morutis and to God.

               ON REMIX. Beaming. PAN across the bright, eager faces of
               LUNGI, SAM, NAILS, THEMBI, NIKI AND LINDI. 

               They BURST into song.

                                                              FADE OUT.
                                   END OF SHOW
