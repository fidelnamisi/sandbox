They analyze the product, not the process.
Writing is about a process.

The reason it's hard to analyze the process is because the mind is engaged during writing. And so to turn part of it in on itself whilst the other part of it is working is virtually impossible.

This is why I have failed many times in my attempts to document my writing process. Not to mention the fact that each story is like a child that needs to be reared and nurtured  in a way that does justice to its own unique needs and personality.

This is why [[the best book on the writing process]] is not about the writing process per se, but about the game of tennis.

The Inner Game of Tennis.
