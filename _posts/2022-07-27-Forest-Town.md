Forest Town
=============

The homeground of the Black Swords Mercenaries, soldiers of fortune.

People say its a highly dangerous part of Jihara and pretty lawless.

A thick almost rainforest like cover of trees that's not easy to penetrate. The town itself is built on platforms in the trees.

Inside, the huts are luxurious and comfortably laid out and well looked after by the wives and concubines of the mercneraries.
