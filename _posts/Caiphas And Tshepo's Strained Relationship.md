Caiphas pulled into the parking lot outside the grey stone mansion surrounded by well manicured lawns and a high brick wall and electric fence. The Chuene Civils office was located in a refurbished colonial house in an affluent part of Johannesburg. Tshepo Chuene, Caiphas's father, had bought it several years earlier and converted it into an office. As Caiphas stepped out of his sports car, he saw the familiar silver Mercedes Benz pulling into the space beside his. The trim, balding old man that stepped out was wearing a grey suit, but didn't wear a tie. He paused as he stood beside the open car door, and exchanged a look with Caiphas.
"And?" Tshepo Chuene asked.
"We got it."
"Good," Tshepo said, and closed the car door. He stalked across the flagstones that joined the parking lot the double wooden doors at the entrance of the office. Caiphas's face fell. He wondered if he would ever satisfy his father, if his father would ever be proud of him. As always he pushed the thought out of his mind. Today, he had decided that nothing was going to get him down. The day had started wonderfully with the journalist's interview and the win with the restaurant. Nothing and no one was going to get him down. Not even his father. He grabbed his suitcase from the passenger side of the car, and slammed the door shut.

As Caiphas stepped into his office and tossed his suitcase on the leather couch by the window overlooking the garden, he felt his phone vibrate. It was an incoming email. He tapped it open, and leaned back on his office table to read it.

"Thanks again for the interview. I've attached a rough draft of the article. Please let me know of any changes. It needs to go out tomorrow morning. Thanks again. Thato."

Caiphas tapped on his phone screen again to open up the article. The font was tiny, and he pinched the screen to zoom out.

bald. The look suited him, making him look younger than his sixty seven years of age.
"Good news, dad. We got the restaurant."
"And the terms?"
Caiphas's face fell. He felt his father still did not trust him. 
"What we agreed on. No profit share."
"Good," his father replied, without the slightest trace of satisfaction in his voice or in his face. "Are you headed to the site?"
"Yes, just swapping cars."
"Okay," Tshepo Chuene said, and strode into the office. Caiphas followed him in wordlessly.

Caiphas stepped into his little office at Chuene Civils and pulled open a drawer. He threw in the keys of the sports car, and pulled out those of the 4x4 double cab pick-up truck in the parking lot. A notification popped up on his phone.
