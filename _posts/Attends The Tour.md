## Attends The Tour

**Synopsis**  

**Text**  
He found Elsie already in the middle of the first tour, surrounded by a small crowd of visitors who paid attention to her every word and stared at the items on exhibition in wide eyed curiosity. 
"Er, excuse me ma'am, no pictures," Elsie pointed at a notice pinned to the wall. The lady she was speaking to reluctantly put her cellphone back in her handbag.
"These items are all of great historical and cultural significance," Elsie continued, as she walked towards the long, low display case huddled against the furthest wall. Inside it were all the amulets, beadwork, ox-hide shields and headdresses that Stan had unpacked and arranged two nights before.
"These are the typical weapons of the Luo tribe up north in Kenya. Does anyone know any famous Luo people?"
"Wasn't Barrack Obama's father Luo?" a blonde haired girl in round nerdy looking glasses piped up.
"Yes, that is correct. And who else?" The listeners were stumped, and just stared back at Elsie.
"Who else guys. Someone you all know... Hint: academy award winning actress?"
"Lupita!" another girl shouted. 
"Yes," Elsie beamed. "These weapons date back to the eighteenth century. The ox-hide shields are more recent though. Notice the shields," she said, pointing at the large, oval, shields made of dark brown ox-hide. "Those decorative white stripes are the typical markers of Luo battle shields.  The white and black ostrich-feather headdresses are also very typically Luo." She pointed at a large framed picture mounted on the wall. "This photo was taken at the turn of the previous century. These are Luo warriors in full battle regalia. I know it's blurry and black and white, but if you look closely, you'll recongnize the same designs on their shields. And of course, the ostrich headdresses make them really stand out, don't they?" There were a few murmurs of agreement. 

Stan wandered over to the stone spear, at the far end of the display case. Now that there was some sunshine in the room, the spear looked different than it did the night before. It seemed to glow in the natural light, and he could make out tiny markings on its cold, smooth shaft. He leaned in for a closer look, taking in the twin spear heads at both ends of the shaft, and the concentric rings just below them, on both sides. The shaft was black, smooth and highly polished. He zoned out of Elsie's droning tour-guide voice.

"You will note the use of iron for their spear and arrow heads, an innovation that is relatively recent. By recent I mean in the last five or six hundred years or so."
"What did they use before then?" the blonde girl asked. 
"Stone," Elsie replied, glancing at Stan standing next to the stone spear. Stan had just noticed what looked like Egyptian hieroglyphics cut into the polished spear shaft. One symbol was larger than the rest, and was carved repeatedly within the concentric circles. It looked like a little bird standing on a box that held a downward pointing bolt of lightning and a roughly sketched fish, but he wasn't quite sure.

 Elsie's voice brought him back to his surroundings.
"Perhaps our Designer, Stan, can tell us what he has noticed about the stone spear?" Stan knew she was trying to tease him.
"No, I haven't noticed anything," Stan said, straightening up and backing away from the display case.
"The particular piece that he is looking at," Elsie continued, guiding the visitors towards the long, black shaft in the display case, "is one of a kind. Whilst we have come across several stone tipped spears in various archeological digs, this is the first time that archeologists on the continent have ever come across a full length spear made entirely out of one block of stone."
"That's impossible," someone whispered. "Surely it would break?"
"How much does it weigh?" another person asked.
"It weighs twenty two and half kilos," Elsie answered, "and the find is so recent that we haven't been fully able to run all the tests that we would like on it."
"How recent?" the blonde girl asked.
"It was discovered only last year," Elsie answered, "in a rock formation near the shores of Lake Victoria. It was encased within a massive hunk of granite rock, which over time eroded little by little, and eventually exposed the spear tip. The granite rock is revered by the people in the area, because it is associated with the legend of Lwanda Magere, and to this day, people still go there to offer sacrifices to their ancestors. It was one such villager who noticed the spear tip jutting out of the rocks the day after a small rockfall had been triggered by an earth tremor. Archeologists descended on the site and were able, over several months, to extract the stone spear from the granite rock that encased it. And what really stumped them is that this spear seems to be a long, long way away from home."
"Where's it's home?" the blonde girl asked.
"The hieroglyphics on the arrow shaft lead us to believe that it's from ancient Egypt. And if you look closely, you will observe the signature of the first of the Egyptian Pharoahs that we know of, whose name is symbolized by the catfish and the chisel, spelling the name 'Narmer'." Stan's heart jumped. He had heard that name before. 

"We are still trying to work out the connection between an ancient Egyptian spear that was out of place, and the legend that the locals tell of an ancient warrior named Lwanda Magere."
"Sorry, but what's the legend?" another visitor asked.


"Ah, it's a very interesting story," Elsie said, flipping through her clipboard. "Let me read it to you, because I don't want to miss out on any of the juicy details. Is that okay?" The visitors nodded, and Elsie read them the same story that Gugu had read to her and Stan earlier.
"Oh, wow!" a gangly teenage boy said. "So this is Lwanda's spear?"
"No," Elsie laughed, "Nobody is saying that. This is only a legend. The spear weighs twenty three kilos. Throwing it, or even just carrying it, would have been a herculean task."
"But this Lwanda guy sounds like he could have done it," the gangly teenage boy said, looking impressed.
"That's unlikely," the blonde girl replied. "It was probably just a decoration or something."
"That's what the archeologists in Kenya also thought," Elsie answered. "But when they put it under a microscope to try and find out how old it is, they noticed a number of stains on the spear tip and upper portion of the shaft. They tested the stains and they turned out to be---,"
"Human blood," Stan finished the sentence for her.
"Correct," Elsie said, shooting him an irritated look. "They were human blood stains. So, believe it or not, this spear was actually used as a weapon - whether in battle or ceremonial sacrifices, we do not know - but what we do know that the spear tip is stained in human blood."
The room went deathly quiet. Elsie smiled complacently, happy with the effect that this piece of news had had. Even the rebellious teenagers looked mildly impressed. Stan cleared his throat. "And," he asked, shifting uncomfortably, "What about the hieroglyphics?"
"Thank you Stan," Elsie said, pursing her lips, "I was just about to get to that. If you look carefully at the spear shaft, you will notice some ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics on there."
The visitors crowded in even closer around the spear. 
"Please don't lean on the glass," Elsie warned them, "it's breakable."


"But that is all that we know at the moment. The symbols have been sent to the Egyptologists in France, England the US. They are studying them as we speak."
"So you mean that this spear is from three thousand B.C."
"That is quite possible, yes. Although the blood stains are not that old, of course. They are only four or five hundred years old."
"But how did a stone spear from Ancient Egypt end up in East Africa?"
"That I do not know," Elsie said, "all we do know is that the Luo people claim to have travelled to their present location from the upper reaches of the Nile river. This is why they are called a nilotic people. And this spear is proof of that, or so it seems."

**Notes**  
Questions:
1. What do the hieroglyphics means?
2. How could they be carved into a substance so hard that people are unsure if its even from this planet?
