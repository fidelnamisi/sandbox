You know what I realized today as I was speaking to Tshepo earlier?

Lemme start from the end...

Just now in the prayer I thought to myself : I've spent most of the day trying to get the Digital Garden rags to work, and now they started working in the sample file. Though I wasted time at least I can offer God the conversation I had with Tshepo this morning at Grenadine which was an awesome conversation.

Then I thought but hang on.
The devil wants me to keep parts of my life away from God.

So even though:
1. This digital garden will probably be a waste
2. And a place where #vanity and #bitterness will rear up their heads
I have to
3. Let God into the garden because 
4. There is no good thing which the devil won't try to corrupt and to keep purifying it I have to keep letting God in, into every aspect of my life even if it doesn't seem "apostolate-y" and it feels like a complete #waste of time.
