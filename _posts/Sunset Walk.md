<!---Saturday 01 October 2022--->



At the sunset our lives we will be judged not on where we walked to but on how well we walked the road.
Writing, like a walk, is less about the destination and more about the soft sunlight on your skin, the leaves in rustling in the wind, the easy conversation of pleasant company, the colours of the grass and trees.
Live the now.
Love the now.
