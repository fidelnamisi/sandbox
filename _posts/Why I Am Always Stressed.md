# Why I Am ALWAYS Stressed
  

The reason why I am always under #stress is because my mind constantly comes up with ideas and thoughts. When writing stories it gives rise to blockages. In daily living, I am always thinking of what I have to do or what I ought to do, or could do, or haven't done or whst could go wrong. This keeps me stressed, because I lack an active framework for discarding thoughts and ideas and tasks that are ineffective: the right thought at the right time. So I always feel like I am not as efficient as I should be.

  

In short: because I lack #effectiveness, I feel I lack #efficiency. B cause I am not always clear on what I should be doing amd why, at any point in time, I have no way of judging if my output / time is good or bad.

  

Basically, I want to build an active framework for sifting through every thought that comes to mind..,discarding most, keeping a few good, true and beautiful ones.

  

Start.

  

The other reason why I am always stressed is analogous to long distance running. When running long distance, often times if I start sprinting, I get drained, start walking and take longer to finish the course. And I start sprinting precisely because I am impatient for my own excellence...I want to feed or build a self image of being super fit and awesome ...and want others to buy into it.

  

What time represents in running, space represents in doing projects or reading books. Because I am seeking my own excellence, I try and cram too much into the same limited space. I try to do too many things, read too many books, capture too many ideas. I want it all and I want it now...so rather than doing things consequently, I try and do them simultaneously...because I am seeking myself...just as when running.

  

This burns me out' makes me unhappy, I get less done and finish fewer things...

  

I want to change.mi genuinely want to change, and run like a pro, not an amateur...it's funny how pros need a coach whose primary work is to get them to pace themselves correctly. God didn't give us an explicit commandment to work, but rather to rest.
