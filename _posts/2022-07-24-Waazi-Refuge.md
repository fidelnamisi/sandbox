Hideout of the sorcerers trying to escape the strict laws against magic 

People say the area is protected by very dangerous curses and anyone who approaches will die a painful death.

On the outside it just looks like a glade in the forest. Within the magical shield, there is a colony of small huts.
 
The huts are simply furnished with animal skin rugs and hastily-made stools, since the Wa'azi had to flee quickly and could carry very little.
