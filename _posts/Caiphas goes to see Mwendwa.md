Caiphas stared at the jet black obelisk that lay on his kitchen counter. He made it stand on it's base and placed a coffee cup next to it. They were just about the same height. More than anything, it reminded him of a bullet, but much larger in size and with squared-off edges. So this was what the whole big deal was about?
He picked up the obelisk and weighed it in his hands. It's weight always surprised him. Despite being relatively small, it felt like it weighed a ton. He got up and went to his bathroom, and returned a moment later with a weighing scale. He put the obelisk on it. It weighed 10 kilos.
"That's a massive weight to hang around your neck," he thought to himself as he took it off the scale and remembered what the sangoma had told him. He strung a leather string through the round gaping hole near its bottom, tied the ends together and hoisted it around his neck. The weight almost made him collapse to the floor. It was much heavier around his neck than when he held it in his hands. He took it off quickly and put it back on the kitchen counter.
"Just what is that sangoma going to do with it?" he wondered as he took a butter knife out of a kitchen cupboard and placed it's edge gently on the obelisk. He tried to nick it, but nothing happened. He chipped away at it a few times with the knife, but stopped when he noticed that the knife blade was getting chipped. He frowned. There seemed to be no way of destroying the thing. What was that sangoma going to do, which he himself couldn't do? He went back to his room and returned a second later with a backpack. He put the obelisk in the backpack, lugged it back to his room, and stepped into the shower.

A few moments later, he was driving into the busy one-way streets of downtown Johannesburg. The traffic was atrocious, and he was grateful that he had put his backpack in the boot of his car. The last thing he wanted was for someone to smash and grab the obelisk.

As he ascended the winding steps that led to the sangoma's consultation office, he felt the weight in his backpack grow heavier and heavier. He had called earlier to make an appointment to see the man, and he truly hoped that he wouldn't have to wait as he had had to do the first time around. It would be really uncomfortable sitting in the waiting room, with all of those weirdos staring at him, and acting as if everything was alright and under control.

When he got to the top of the steps, the door was slightly ajar. He knocked twice, and almost immediately the thin, reedy voice from within answered.
"Yes?" 
He pushed the door open and stepped into the waiting room. It looked much tidier than it had the previous time, like someone had actually stepped in and dusted the seats and mopped the floors. Caiphas was grateful. Before it had just been a little too much to bear.
"You brought it?" Mwendwa asked, failing to suppress the distance note of eagerness in his voice.
Caiphas didn't respond, but slowly unzipped his bag and took out the obelisk. He had wrapped it in bubble-wrap, as an additional protective measure. He handed it to Mwendwa, who grabbed it with both hands and sank immediately under it's weight.
"Careful with it," Caiphas said quicly. "It's quite heavy." Mwendwa set it on the table in the waiting room. It creaked under it's weight, and Caiphas hoped that the table wouldn't collapse. Mwendwa crossed over to the door, stuck his head out, looked up and down the passage, then closed the door again and turned the key in the lock.
"We're the only ones here today?" Caiphas asked.
"Yes," Mwendwa replied, crossing back to the room and kneeling next to the obelisk. He stared at it greedily, and whistled.
"So, it's true," he muttered to himself in Kikamba.
"What did you say?" Caiphas asked, suddenly suspicious. There was something about Mwendwa's movements and body language which was setting him on edge.
"Nothing," Mwendwa said, straightening up quickly. "I was just saying that it's bigger than I thought it would be."
"Oh," Caiphas said, eyes narrowing.
"Let's get it into my office," Mwendwa said, "Please help me." He started to pick up the obelisk, and Caiphas pushed him aside roughly. "I'll do it." Anger flitted through Mwendwa's face, but he pushed it aside quickly and forced a smile and a jovial tone into his voice.
"Thank you," he said, leading the way into his room. "I cancelled all my other appointments for today so that we could be alone. This is a very important operation that we are going to carry out, and we need to be undisturbed as we do it."
"How long is it going to take?"
"I have no idea," Mwendwa replied, as he opened the windows of his office and drew the curtains. There was a small metal bucket with holes poked in the sides in the middle of the room, and little bits of wood inside. A box of matches was on the floor next to it.
"You're going to start a fire?"
"Yes, we need it for the ceremony."
"What are you going to do?"
"You'll see shortly. Please place the spear here," he pointed at the floor next to the bucket. Caiphas did as instructed and sat down on the straw mat, and watched. Mwendwa took the matches and struck them. In a few minutes, there was a raging fire in the little bucket. Caiphas was surprised by how little smoke it made, and wondered whether Mwendwa had used some special materials because the last time he was here, he had almost been choked to death by all the smoke.
When the flames were leaping out of the top of the bucket, Mwendwa got up and crossed to one of the shelves lining the wall of the room. He opened a tiny little jar, and took out something that Caiphas couldn't make out, and cupped it in his hand and crossed back to his spot on the floor beside the raging fire. He knelt down on his haunches, leaned back, closed his eyes and muttered something in the language that Caiphas now knew was his native Kikamba.
"Put the spear in the fire."
"Why do you keep calling it a spear? It's an obelisk."
"It was used as a spear. It is the spear of conquest. Put it in the fire," Mwendwa repeated.
"But, it will ---"
"Nothing will happen to it. Haven't you realised by now that the spear is indestructible?" Mwendwa sounded irritated at being questioned by Caiphas. Caiphase gulped down his fear, lifted the obelisk with some difficulty, and started to lower it slowly into the fire. It's top was smooth, and he had difficulty holding onto it from it's top. It started sliding out of his hands. 
"Please help --- it's slipping." Mwendwa pulled the leather pouch that hung around his neck off, and poured out the contents of his cupped hands onto it's smooth surface. Caiphas caught a glimpse of the white, gleaming powder, as Mwendwa got to his feet and grabbed one side of the obelisk. Both of them lifted, and together they dropped the obelisk into the bucket. With a clang it hit the hard metallic bottom, and there was a cloud of sparks as the flames dipped and dwindled. Then in an instant they were back up again and raging.
Mwendwa scooped up the white powder into his hands again, closed his eyes and muttered more incantations in Kikamba. He stretched his hand out over the fire, and let the powder fall into the flames. The flames leaped and crackled angrily, changing colour from orange to blue-white. They watched the flames burn for a few seconds more, before they suddenly went out, and all that was left was a thin wisp of smoke, winding it's way up towards the ceiling and out of the open window.
Mwendwa got up and crossed over the shelf. He returned a few minutes later with a table spoon and a glass of water. He set them beside the bucket, leaned into it with the spoon, scooped up some ashes, and tipped them into the glass of water. There was a soft hiss as the water went fizzy for a few seconds, and Mwendwa stirred the glass rapidly with the spoon.
"Here," he said, holding the glass out towards Caiphas. "Drink this."
"What?" Caiphas' eyes turned from the glass to Mwendwa, and back to the glass again. The water was milky now. There was no way it was a good idea to drink that stuff.
"You have to drink from the ashes of the spear. Do you want the power of conquest?"
"Yes, I do, but---"
"Drink," Mwendwa repeat.
Caiphas hesitantly took the glass and sniffed it first. It was nothing unexpected, just the faint smell of ashes on the water. Might as well get this over with, he thought to himself, as he took a deep breathe, held it, closed his eyes, and tipped the contents down his throat. He gagged. It was bitter. Very bitter. He forced it down in two swallows, and put the glass down, grimacing, squeezing his eyes shut against the bitter after taste. When he opened them again, he found Mwendwa staring at him with a hungry look in his eyes.
"Did it work?" he asked.
"What do you mean?"
"Do you feel anything different."
"No, not at all."
"Give it a minute---"
"Aah," Caiphas groaned and clutched his stomach, as he felt a powerful spasm run through him and squeeze all his insides into a tight bunch. He turned to Mwendwa, in agony. Mwendwa was grinning broadly. Caiphas began to understand what was happening to him, and as understanding grew, so did his sense of panic.
"You son of a--- "  The world swam before his eyes, and the last thing he saw was the sangoma's pointed face jutting out towards him, hungry and excited.
