When Elsie woke up that morning, she found that her younger sister, Lwazi, was feeling under the weather with some flu-like symptoms. She dashed off to the pharmacy and bought her some medications, made sure that she was okay to get to school, and then left for work. As she was stepping out of the house, she dashed off a quick message on the Museum's Chat group on her phone, letting them know that she was running half an hour late.
When she got to the gates of the museum, she immediately noticed that something was wrong. Firstly, Bongani was not at his post in the guard house, which didn't immediately strike her as odd, until, from the gate, she noticed that there was a police car parked outside the entrance of the museum. She scanned the immediate vicinity to see if there was any sign of Bongani, so that she could find out what was going on, but when she didn't see him, she figured that he must be inside the museum, with the police, for whatever reason it was that they were there to begin with.
When she walked in through the sliding glass doors, Chichi, Caiphas, Gugu and Stan were all standing there, with arms folded and downcast faces, next to a policeman who was leaning on the reception table and jotting something down in a notebook. Chichi was wiping tears away from her eyes.
"Hey guys. What's happening?"
"I've been trying to call you all morning. What's up with your phone?"
"Nothing," she replied, pulling her phone out of her bag. At that moment she realised that it was still on flight mode.
"Sorry, it was off," she said, turning it on again. It buzzed angrily as a flurry of incoming message notifications appeared on her screen from the museum chat group.
"What's happening?" she asked, looking up from her phone to the distraught faces around her. 
"They found Bongani's dead body in the veld nearby this morning."
"What?" Elsie couldn't believe what she was hearing. Chichi sobbed loudly, and Gugu wrapped a hand around her as she blew on a kleenex.
"Yeah," Caiphas reiterated simply, shrugging. "I got a call from the police early this morning asking to identify him. Someone from one of the squatter camps found a dead body this morning, and called the police. The police searched him and found his museum card, then they called me in to identify him. It was him."
"But --- how?" Elsie asked, the words catching in her throat as tears started welling up within her.
"We don't know," Caiphas answered. "What we do know is that there was a break in last night."
Elsie had to hold onto the reception desk to steady herself.
"But that's impossible," she said weakly, "There's never been a break-in her our whole lives. What's there to steal from here."
"The obelisk," Stan answered, looking pale and care-worn. His voice was husky. "They took the obelisk." Elsie marched off down the passage towards the temporary exhibition area. She had to make sure for herself. She found another two police officers, a man and a woman. The woman was taking photographs of the place, and the man was noting things down in a notebook. 
"Good morning," the female cop said, "How are you?" Elsie ignored the greeting and swept into the space, going straight to the glass display case. Sure enough, everything was there except the tiny obelisk.
"And who are you?" the male cop asked. He had a high-pitched voice that contrasted greatly with his massive size.
"Elsie Mabaso. I'm the educational officer. What else did they take?"
"At the moment, it seems they only took that --- what do you call it?" the male cop asked.
"Obelisk," Elsie replied, as she did a quick check around the room.
"Right," the cop replied, poring over his notes. "The other one, Stan, said that that's the only thing that they seemed to have taken. Can you just confirm that before we leave?"
Elsie did a quick stock take of the room, as well as the adjoining one, and confirmed that the only thing missing was the miniature obelisk. She walked back to the entrance with the two cops.
"Who was the last person to leave here last night?" the female cop asked.
"I was," Elsie answered.
"And you locked up and everything was normal?"
"Yes," Elsie nodded.
"The alarm system did not go off.  Did you set the alarm?"
Elsie was about to answer in the affirmative, then remembered that she had rushed out, under Caiphas's behest. She hesitated for a moment.
"I --- I --- I think I---"
"The alarm system is faulty," Stan interrupted her. "Many times we've set it, then when we get here in the morning we find that it's not activated."
"I've been meaning to get it replaced and checked out."
"Were your artefacts insured?" the female cop asked. She seemed to be the boss, because she asked all the questions, and her partners wrote down all the answers.
"Yes and no," Caiphas replied. "The insurance is more for the fittings. The artefacts themselves are irreplaceable. If one of them goes missing, you're not going to be able to buy a replacement."
"And is there a market for these things? Why would anyone want to steal something from the museum."
"Like I said," Caiphas said, "I've never heard of this happening before in my life. The only artefacts that get stolen are the things from ancient Egypt. They can be sold for ridiculous sums of money on the black market in Europe. But no one cares about the things from sub-Saharan Africa."
"Nonsense," Stan said, defensively.
"Hard to accept, but it's true."
"I see," the female cop replied, gazing at each of them in turn as if they themselves were suspects. "And all of you can account for your whereabouts last night?"
Caiphas walked in at the moment. He took one look at everyone and everything, and walked over to them immediately.
"What's going on?"
"There's been a robbery," Gugu answered him.
They briefed him in a couple of seconds. The female cop resumed her line of questioning. All of them attested that they had been at home. She got to Elsie. 
"And yourself, ma'am. You were the last to leave here. What time did you leave and why did you leave so late?"
All eyes turned towards Caiphas and Elsie. Elsie blushed.
"We were, er---," Elsie stammered and cleared her throat, wishing the ground would open up and swallow her entirely.
"We had dinner together," Caiphas completed the sentence for her. "It was a date. Just the two of us in the restaurant." Stan visibly stiffened, and glared at Caiphas as though he would rip his head off. Caiphas continued. "We must have left here at around half past eight or nine. Bongani was at his guard house and he opened for us. I dropped her off at home, " he said, nodding at Elsie, "and then I went home myself."
"And do you have anyone that can confirm where you were after you got home?"
"No, not really. I live alone."
"Okay," the policewoman said, turning to Caiphas. "You'll have to come with us to the police station to open up a docket for the case and to write a statement."
"Any leads about ---," Elsie couldn't bring herself to say Bongani's name.
"No, none at the moment, but it's quite obvious that whoever broke in and stole the item from the museum, also did away with the guard."
"He probably caught him in the act or caught him leaving," the second policeman said, walking up to them. "We found some signs of a scuffle in the room. There are some stains on the floor that had been wiped up with a cloth. Looks like blood stains."
"I guess that proves that it was not an inside job. In most of these cases, the security is normally involved."
"Bongani would never organise and inside job with anyone," Stan said. "He hated his job, but still, he was a good man."
"Okay," the policewoman said. "We shall keep in touch. Caiphas," she said, turning to him, "Please will you come with us?"
She walked out, accompanied by the other two policemen and Caiphas.
"This is terrible," Gugu mattered.
"Has anyone notified the Professor?" Elsie asked. 
"I tried to call him," Chichi said, choking back her sobs, "but I couldn't get through."
"Yes," Stan muttered, looking at his cellphone. "He was last seen yesterday morning. He's probably in a place with no network."
"He'll see all the messages flooding in when he's back on the network," Elsie said. "Does anyone know Bongani's family?"
