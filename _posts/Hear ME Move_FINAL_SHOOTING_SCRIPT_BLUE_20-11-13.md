                                                               FADE IN.



               EXT. JOBURG ALLEYWAY - EVENING

               MUZI, 21, walks past dirty, gutted, graffiti covered concrete
               walls.

               OPENING CREDITS.



               INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               We're in an underground hip-hop nightclub. Think Cool
               Runnings in Melville. Air pulsating with music. Lasers
               flashing. PEOPLE jostling for space, squeezing around --

               A dance circle. DANCERS take turns going into the circle and
               busting some moves.

               A POWERFULLY BUILT DANCER, dressed in a track-suit executes
               some gravity defying b-boy acrobatics. The crowd is in awe.  

               MUZI, 21, good looking, stocky, wearing a bicep-revealing
               vest and the hero of our tale, leaps into the space with
               alacrity, spinning, wheeling, careening like a man possessed.
               A spectacle to behold.

               He completes his sequence and pauses. From the crowd's
               cheers, there can be no doubt about whose kung fu is
               superior.

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               MUZI weaves his way through the crowd, navigating through
               pats on the back, high fives, nods of respect. A RANDOM GUY
               with his GIRLFRIEND block his way.

                                   RANDOM GUY
                         Hey! Aren't you Spikiri's son?

               Muzi pauses, looks him up and down. Starts to walk away.

                                   GIRLFRIEND
                         Yo man! Your timer took pantsula to
                         another level bra.

               Muzi keeps walking. Random Guy and Girlfriend exchange a
               quizzical look: what's up with that guy?

               PICK UP MUZI AND FOLLOW HIM PAST--

               A roguishly good-looking, imposing young man. Covered in
               bling. PRINCE. 24. Beside him, an attractive young woman,
               PINKY. 

               Prince follows Muzi with his eyes but loses him in the
               jostling crowd.



               EXT. COLLEGE - DAY (NEW DAY)

               We're outside the facade of a college. A FEW STUDENTS stream
               in and out the gates. There's LOUD HOUSE MUSIC emanating from
               somewhere within.



               EXT. COLLEGE GARDENS - DAY

               Banners everywhere: "DEFY" (or some other similar brand).
               SALES REPS seated at a desk with flyers. Huge speakers next
               to them, blasting music as--

               COLLEGE KIDS watch an informal dance circle happening. 

               Watching from the sidelines, amongst the other eager
               spectators, is MUZI. 

               THAMI, 21, comes up beside him, munching some chips. 

                                   THAMI 
                         Ekse, guess who just hustled two
                         comps to Hear ME Move tomorrow.

               Muzi's barely listening. His eyes are trained squarely on the
               girl who's just gone into the circle - watching her every
               move. She's sassy, beautiful, alluring. KHANYI. 19. Her
               bewitching eyes smile at the crowd. 

                                   THAMI (CONT'D)
                         Hellooo?

               Thami follows Muzi's look. Khanyi exits the circle to the
               cheers and applause of the crowd.

                                   THAMI (CONT'D)
                         You're such a waste man. You know
                         the way girls dig a guy who can
                         dance.

                                   MUZI
                         I can dance.

                                   THAMI 
                         Not secret underground dancing at
                         hip-hop clubs. I mean sbujwa.
                         Kokasi. 

               Muzi shakes his head. 

                                   MUZI
                         That's not me.

                                   THAMI
                         So what? You've still got it in
                         you. And you know sbujwa's what
                         rocks the crowd.
                         You'll see tomorrow at Hear ME
                         Move. I bet you a sbujwa crew's
                         going to win.

                                   MUZI
                         Ja whatever.

                                   THAMI 
                         Let's bet. Twenty bucks.

               Muzi ignores him and walks away.

                                   THAMI (CONT'D)
                         Okay, ten bucks.

               He goes after Muzi.

                                   THAMI (CONT'D)
                         Five bucks. And I'm saying Sbujwa
                         Nation are taking it.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP - MORNING (NEW DAY)

               The crowded, bustling seven am township streets.



               EXT. LERATO'S SPAZA SHOP - MORNING

               A sign: "LERATO'S FINEST AFRICAN CUISINE'.



               INT. LERATO'S SPAZA SHOP - MORNING

               An old woman in her early sixties stands over a deep frying
               pan, frying magwenyas. This is GOGO. MUZI kneads the dough.

                                   GOGO
                         I think we've got enough for a
                         Saturday Muzi.

                                   MUZI
                         Ja. And I have to go.

               LERATO, his mother, late forties, bustles in with plastic
               bags full of shopping.

                                   LERATO
                         You're not going anywhere. It's the
                         end of the month. I need you to
                         help me with the accounts.

               She starts unpacking groceries on the shelf.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         And then I'll need you to go and
                         buy carrots.
                         They're only getting Rudzani's
                         carrots later today.

                                   MUZI
                         Can't I do the accounts tomorrow?
                         I've got this thing with Thami.

                                   LERATO
                         What thing?

               Muzi is silent. Lerato's waits for the answer.

                                   MUZI
                             (grudgingly)
                         It's a dance competition.

                                   LERATO
                         What? Since when are you dancing,
                         Muzi?

                                   MUZI
                         I'm not dancing, ma. Just watching.

               TAP! TAP! A knock on the counter. They turn around to find--

               THAMI. He holds up two tickets.

                                   THAMI 
                         Legai ma Lerato.  Legai Gogo. I
                         just came to pick up Muzi.

                                   LERATO
                         Muzi's got a lot of work Thami.
                         He's not going anywhere.

               There's a tense silence. 

                                   GOGO
                         Lerato. Let him go. 

               Thami hums absent-mindedly, trying to diffuse the situation.
               Lerato turns to Muzi, strangely solemn.

                                   LERATO
                         You promised me, Muzi.

                                   MUZI
                         Ma, I'm not going to dance. I'm
                         just watching. 

               Lerato almost smiles. Muzi turns to Thami.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Let's go!



               EXT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - DAY

               A CROWD OF YOUNG PEOPLE milling around. Two queues at the
               entrance. ATTENDANTS check ticket stubs as people stream in.

               A big banner announces where we are:

               "HEAR ME MOVE - JOBURG QUALIFIERS. PROUDLY SPONSORED BY DEFY
               AND LOVELIFE."



               INT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - DAY

               LOUD HOUSE MUSIC blasting. A CROWD OF SPECTATORS on their
               feet look on as a dance crew called--

               African Revolution do a SBUJWA DANCE SEQUENCE.

               They're all dressed in matching branded t-shirts.

               Thami records them on his phone.

               Muzi's eyes are fixed on a crew standing by the sidelines,
               getting ready to go next. They're eight in total- guys and
               girls. They're dressed in white leather pants and matching
               jackets, and red sneakers with matching red caps. His eyes
               are on one of the girls. KHANYI.

                                   THAMI  
                         See? I told you.
                             (beat)
                         That's her crew. Sbujwa Nation.

               Thami swivels his phone round to focus on Sbujwa Nation.

                                   THAMI (CONT'D)
                         African Revolution don't stand a
                         chance.

               ON SBUJWA NATION--

               ORA, 20. Good looking and ripped. ZEE, 19, with a lollipop in
               his mouth - his trademark. SHOES, 29, not in uniform, older
               and more mature than the others. He has an air of authority
               about him.

               These, along with Khanyi, are the heart of the group. 

                                   KHANYI
                         It's not like we have a choice.
                         We've given him half an hour
                         already. 

                                   P.A. SYSTEM (O.C.)
                         And facing off with African
                         Revolution, to decide who will
                         represent Jozi at the Hear Me Move
                         Finals - guys and girls - give it
                         up for Sbujwa Nation.

               Shoes's face darkens into a heavy frown. 

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET - DAY

               Cars are parked on a street. Doors open. Music blaring. A
               CROWD - mainly girls - have formed a circle around ...

               TWO GROUPS FACING OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A DANCE BATTLE.

               The members of both groups are dressed in costly colourful
               shirts and shoes. They're covered in jewellery. A small fire
               rages in the centre of the circle.

               ONE DANCER is doing a solo dance, to the cheers and whistles
               of the crowd. He takes off his costly shirt and throws it
               into the fire. 

               The crowd starts chanting - "PRINCE. PRINCE. PRINCE".

               PRINCE leaps into the circle.

               He dances with tremendous energy and verve. He takes every
               move that his opponent did and makes it bigger and better.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:



               INT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - DAY

               SBUJWA NATION step onto the dance circle. The music starts
               up.

               SBUJWA NATION launch into a SBUJWA DANCE SEQUENCE. 

               They're well timed. Coordinated. 

               And pretty damn good.

               Muzi watches in delight. Through his eyes, their moves are
               slowed down. Poetic. Almost dream-like. Muzi's eyes follow
               every single motion in awe. It's so perfect. So disciplined.

               ON SBUJWA NATION--

               As they complete their sequence. The audience whoops and
               yells.

                                   P.A. SYSTEM (O.C.)
                         Audience. Your votes please.
                             (beat)
                         African Revolution are green.
                         Sbujwa Nation, red.
                             (beat)
                         African Revolution?

               A number of green cards go up in the air, but they are less
               than half the crowd.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET - DAY

               PRINCE takes a couple of hundred rand notes and throws them
               into the fire. THE CROWD goes ballistic. His opponents throw
               up their hands, conceding defeat.

               Prince takes his shoes off and throws them into the fire as
               well. He swaggers to a waiting BMW 5 series gusheshe. THE
               DRIVER revs the engine.  Prince gets in.

               The car SPINS in loops and loops, screeching and throwing up
               clouds of dust.

               A pair of feet stick out the window - and they're donning new
               shoes. The crowd can't contain themselves, screaming in
               delight.

               The feet go back in and Prince's head pops out. He sits on
               the window's edge and cackles like a maniac. 

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:



               INT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - DAY

                                   P.A. SYSTEM (O.C.)
                         Sbujwa Nation?

               Red cards dot most of the arena. It's a definite win for
               Sbujwa Nation. 

                                   P.A. SYSTEM (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                         Judges?

               The THREE CELEBRITY JUDGES hold up red cards. The crowd
               breaks into more cheering.

                                   P.A. SYSTEM (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                         And Sbujwa Nation are through.
                         Sbujwa Nation will represent Joburg
                         at the Hear Me Move finals next
                         month. They now stand a chance to
                         win two hundred and fifty thousand
                         rand and a tour of the States.

               ON SBUJWA NATION--

               Khanyi, Ora, Shoes and Zee are ecstatic. Hugs, tears, high
               fives all around. African Revolution shake hands with them
               like good sportsmen.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET - DAY

               The car cruises down the street as a few girls chase after
               it, screaming their heads off in nubile euphoria.

               Prince yells and extends his hands, letting the beamer spirit
               him away, an eagle soaring over it's domain.



               EXT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - DAY

               THAMI is right in the middle of placing a bet with ARNOLD,
               early twenties. 

                                   THAMI
                         Do you even know who Spikiri was?
                         He was a legend. I'm telling you
                         his kid can beat you any day.

                                   ARNOLD
                         I don't know about no Spikiri.

                                   THAMI
                         Let's bet. A clipper. Muzi can beat
                         you.

                                   ARNOLD
                         Two clipper.

                                   THAMI
                         Deal.

               MUZI walks up to them.

                                   THAMI (CONT'D)
                         Just made you a quick two clipper.

                                   MUZI
                         What?

               Arnold takes his phone out and plays a HOUSE TRACK.

               He does a couple of sbujwa moves, ending up right in Muzi's
               face. 

               A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS quickly forms around them -- eager  to
               see the battle.

               Muzi shakes his head, smiles.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         I don't do sbujwa.

               Arnold turns to Thami, sticks his hand out.

                                   ARNOLD
                         Two clipper. Lethe.

               Thami gulps, turns to Muzi, pleads.

                                   THAMI
                         Please bafwethu.
                             (harsh whisper)
                         I don't have the money.

                                   MUZI
                         You must think before you talk
                         then.

               Muzi starts to walk away. Thami turns to Arnold.

                                   THAMI
                         Sho my man. Looks like he's not
                         feeling it today but--

               Arnold grabs a beer bottle off the ground and smashes it
               against the pavement. He grabs Thami's collar and holds up
               the jagged bottle edge inches away from Thami's neck.

                                   ARNOLD
                         Lethe.

               Muzi swivels round at the sound of the breaking glass. He
               sees Thami panicking, backing away. Sizes up the situation
               instantly. He walks up to Arnold - not a trace of fear.

                                   MUZI
                         Okay. You want to lose your money?
                         Let's do it.

               Arnold let's go of Thami. He starts up the music playing off
               his phone again.

               He executes some deft sbujwa moves. 

               Now it's Muzi's turn.

               He breaks out into a sbujwa explosion. For someone who
               doesn't do sbujwa, he's damn good. The crowd whoops and yells
               for Muzi, amazed by the fluid moves, the power, the passion.

               ON SHOES.

               In the middle of the crowd. Watching the spectacle. He looks
               on with keen interest. There's something about this boy...

               Arnold tosses up his hands - a gesture of defeat - starts to
               walk away. Thami blocks his way, arm outstretched.

                                   THAMI
                         That will be two hundred rand
                         please.

               Arnold takes the money out grudgingly, hands it to Thami.

                                   THAMI (CONT'D)
                         Dankie ngiyabonga.

               He gives one hundred to Muzi. Muzi takes both notes.

                                   MUZI
                         Dankie ngiyabonga.

               Muzi pockets the money, turns around to find--

               SHOES. Looking at Muzi as if Muzi should recognize him.

                                   SHOES
                         Heita. Those were some tight moves
                         back there. Muzi, right?

                                   MUZI
                         Sorry mfethu but I don't know you.

                                   SHOES
                         Oh ja, of course you don't remember
                         me. It's been twelve years. 

               Muzi's face lights up with recognition.

                                   MUZI
                         Uncle Shoes?

                                   SHOES
                         Ja. I heard you stopped dancing
                         after -- your father --

               Muzi nods.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         But what you did back there was
                         amazing -- for someone who doesn't
                         dance.

               Muzi is embarrassed.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         You in a crew?

               Muzi shakes his head.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Great. You must join mine. Sbujwa
                         Nation. We'd love to have you.

               Muzi smiles.

                                   MUZI
                         I don't do sbujwa.
                             (beat)
                         And I don't do crews.

               ON PRINCE.

               Shoving his way through the crowd towards Shoes. Seething
               with rage. Stands between Shoes and Muzi.

                                   PRINCE
                         You guys went on without me?

                                   SHOES
                         You were late.

               KHANYI, ZEE and ORA show up. 

                                   PRINCE
                         You couldn't even wait for me? Who
                         was boss?

                                   KHANYI
                         Doesn't matter. The point is you
                         make us look unprofessional.

                                   PRINCE
                         I make you guys. Full stop.

                                   ORA
                         We just qualified without you in
                         case you didn't notice.

                                   PRINCE
                         Using my moves!

                                   KHANYI
                         Shoes's choreographed them.

                                   PRINCE
                         What? This burnt out timer who
                         can't dance anymore? Without me you
                         guys are nothing.

                                   SHOES
                         Prince! I'm enough with your big
                         mouth. You don't own and run this
                         crew. You are part of a team. And
                         if you can't understand that then
                         you can leave.

                                   PRINCE
                             (scoffs)
                         Oh ja! Who's going to replace me?

               Shoes shoots a look at Muzi. Prince catches this. Muzi steps
               back.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Ow. I see what's going on here.
                             (beat)
                         You see me coming up so you decide
                         to replace me with your old boss's
                         kid?

               Shoes and Muzi are both surprised.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Ja. I saw you at that club in
                         Rosebank. Everyone was talking
                         about your father. You know...the
                         druggie.

                                   SHOES
                         Don't be foolish Prince.

               Prince gazes at each Sbujwa Nation member in turn. The moment
               is heavy with tension.

                                   PRINCE
                         See you at the finals.

               He wheels around and storms off. 

               Shoes takes a deep breath, turns to Muzi.

                                   SHOES
                         I'm sorry you had to see that.

                                   MUZI
                         Is it true? 

                                   SHOES
                         Is what true?

                                   MUZI
                         Are you choosing me just because
                         I'm Spikiri's son.

                                   SHOES
                         I'm choosing you because you're one
                         of the best dancers I've ever seen.

               Muzi starts to walk off. Shoes goes after him.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Muzi. Listen.

               They're some distance from the crowd now. Shoes lowers his
               voice.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Muzi, listen to me.

                                   MUZI
                         You don't know what it's like. You
                         don't know what it's like to have
                         people say my father's name
                         everywhere I go. Reminding me about
                         the drugs. Every time. For the last
                         twelve years. 

               Shoes looks away.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         And now you want me to walk
                         straight into more of the same
                         crap? Sorry. You've got the wrong
                         guy.

               He walks away.

                                   SHOES
                         Everything you heard about your
                         father was a lie.

               Muzi stops. Shocked. Turns to face Shoes. 

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         How he lived. How he died. You
                         don't know the true story.

               Shoes approaches him, face to face.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         It's time you became your own man,
                         Muzi. It's time you found out the
                         truth for yourself.
                             (beat)
                         You're a dancer. It's inside of
                         you. It keeps you awake at night.
                         Trust me. I know. 
                             (beat)
                         I've known for the last twelve
                         years.

               He doesn't wait for an answer. Just spins around and walks
               away. Muzi watches him go. Thami comes up.

                                   THAMI
                         Ekse. What's going on?

                                   MUZI
                         Nix. Let's go.

               Muzi leaves.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - DAY

               Sun set over the busy streets kokasi.



               EXT. LERATO'S SPAZA SHOP - DAY

               MUZI trudges in, a worried frown on his face.



               INT. LERATO'S KITCHEN - DAY

               MUZI walks past LERATO stacking dishes, as if she isn't
               there.

                                   LERATO
                         Hau! Muzi. You don't even say
                         hello.

                                   MUZI
                         Sorry ma.

                                   LERATO
                         How was the competition?

                                   MUZI
                         Fine.

                                   LERATO
                         So you'll finish those accounts for
                         me?

                                   MUZI
                         Ja.

                                   LERATO
                         What's eating you Muzi?

                                   MUZI
                         Nothing. I just...

               He searches for the right words. 

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         I'm just tired.

               He walks off to his room.



               INT. MUZI'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Muzi rummages through an old shoe box. He pulls out a
               yellowing photo of a boy, the YOUNG MUZI, 9, and a man in his
               mid-twenties, SPIKIRI. They're in a garden:  all smiles, hugs
               and happiness. 

               He stares at the photo long and hard.



               INT. LERATO'S DINING ROOM - EVENING

               LERATO, GOGO and MUZI are seated having dinner.

                                   MUZI
                         Ma? How come we don't have a photo
                         of Pa anywhere in the house?

               Lerato and Gogo exchange a look. Lerato dishes up for Muzi.

                                   LERATO
                         What are you trying to say Muzi?

                                   MUZI
                         I'm starting to forget what he
                         looked like.

                                   LERATO
                         It's been twelve years since he
                         passed. 
                             (beat)
                         And why are you asking all of this
                         now?

               Muzi is silent.

                                   MUZI
                         I just wish I knew more about him,
                         that's all.

                                   LERATO
                         Well he didn't care enough to want
                         to get to know you.

                                   GOGO
                         Lerato!

                                   LERATO
                         It's the truth.

               Muzi gets up.

                                   MUZI
                         I'm not hungry.

               He starts to leave.

                                   LERATO
                         Where are you going?

                                   MUZI
                         To Thami's. We've got a project for
                         school. 

               He exits. Gogo shrugs, shakes her head.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - EVENING

               MUZI trudges through the township streets, immersed in
               thought. Doesn't notice anyone or anything.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - EVENING

               Muzi hops into a taxi.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD

               Concrete bridges. Street art. Colourful shop facades.
               Graffiti. 



               EXT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING

               We're outside a derelict warehouse. Muzi walks towards a
               brightly coloured door. He hears faint music. 

               He stops outside the door and knocks.

               No response. He knocks again. Louder this time.

               The door cracks open. 

                                   SHOES
                         Muzi! 

                                   MUZI
                         Twelve years later and you're still
                         in the same place?

               Shoes chuckles. 

                                   SHOES
                         Teachers don't get a lot of money.
                             (beat)
                         So--er. Ja, come in. I don't have
                         cool drink but I've got some --er- 

                                   MUZI
                             (interrupts)
                         I want to join Sbujwa Nation.

                                   SHOES
                         What?

                                   MUZI
                         You heard me. 
                             (beat)
                         Where do we rehearse?

               Shoes smiles.

                                   SHOES
                         Where else?

                                                                CUT TO:



               ***SCENE DELETED***



               ***SCENE DELETED***



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY (NEW DAY)

               The warehouse is largely bare. A few odds and ends in the
               corners - old tires. Abandoned car seat. Empty beer bottles.
               HEAVY HOUSE BEATS emanate through the space.

               ZEE, with his faithful lollipop, and OTHER DANCERS are
               warming up. 

               SHOES sorts through some CDs in the corner.  KHANYI does some
               street art on the walls, trying to ignore the skateboard
               toting ORA, all up in her face.

                                   ORA
                             (to Khanyi)
                         So I  told them I'd report them for
                         having an eighteen year old in an
                         under eighteen crew. That guy
                         looked like my father.

                                   KHANYI
                         Ora, it's really none of your
                         business hey.

                                   ORA
                         But it's not right. 

               He looks at the painting.

                                   ORA (CONT'D)
                         Hey, that's really cool. 
                             (beat)
                         I've got a cool design I want you
                         to do for me on my skateboard.

               Khanyi rolls her eyes. 

                                   KHANYI
                         Ja, too bad you can't afford me,
                         hey?

                                   ORA
                         Oh come on, Khanyi. Please...

               MUZI walks in. Pauses and looks around. The others fall
               silent, regard him with some surprise. Shoes stops the music.

                                   SHOES
                         You're late.

                                   MUZI
                         I was busy with classes, hey.

                                   SHOES
                         Everyone here's busy with classes.
                         But out of respect they organize
                         their time. We're like a family.
                         If there's no respect, there's
                         nothing. Clear?

               Muzi isn't listening. He's taking in the space, checking out
               the other dancers. He spots Khanyi. Without taking his eyes
               off her--

                                   MUZI
                         Where can I change?

                                   SHOES
                             (frustrated)
                         Round the back.

               Muzi grabs his bag, saunters out. Shoes's face narrows. This
               kid's going to be trouble.

               Muzi exchanges a look with Khanyi as he walks out. She hides
               her smile. Ora spots this exchange and frowns.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - EVENING

               We're in another part of Joburg.



               EXT. TAVERN - EVENING

               "SIPHO'S FIVE STAR SPORTS BAR".



               INT. TAVERN - EVENING

               Pool tables. Cigarette smoke. YOUNG GUYS and GIRLS lounging
               around a bar. The typical place where university kids who
               skip class would hang out.

               At a pool table, ARNOLD and T-BOZ, 20 are in the middle of a
               game. PINKY, the attractive girl we saw earlier, looks on. 

               T-BOZ lines up his cue for a shot. He strikes the ball but--

               What the?? His cue doesn't move. He turns around to find--

               PRINCE. His hand on the cue stick. A grim smile on his face.

                                   PRINCE
                         So Mzansi's best dancers spend time
                         playing pool and getting pooza
                         faces instead of trying to go to
                         the States?

                                   T-BOZ
                         Ey mfana. We're busy here.

               He takes the shot. Misses the pocket. Prince takes the cue
               stick.

                                   PRINCE
                         Small boy.

               He takes the shot. 

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         No Ambition.

               He pockets the ball. Looks at T-Boz.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Mara you say you want to see the
                         world, neh?

               He pockets another ball. Goes up to Arnold.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Those girls you're chasing after
                         won't remember you with your pooza
                         face, son.

               He pinches his cheek. Arnold slaps his hand away. Prince
               smirks. Stops in front of Pinky.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         And you? You want to be famous? 

               He pockets another ball.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Keep dreaming.

               Pinky meets his eyes, defiant.

                                   PINKY
                         What do you want, Prince?

                                   PRINCE
                         I've got great news. 
                             (beat)
                         I'm letting you join my new crew.
                         I've got a few weeks to shape you
                         up and get you to the Hear Me Move
                         qualifiers. 

                                   ARNOLD
                         You're too late. We missed them
                         already.

                                   PRINCE
                         That was Jozi. There's still Cape
                         Town and Rustenberg and Durbs and
                         Pretoria coming up.

               He pockets another ball.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         We could go to Pretoria. Or we
                         could go to Rusty. You guys seem
                         too broke for Cape Town.

               He pockets another ball.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         The main thing is that we'll get to
                         the finals, and then, we'll show
                         the world what sbujwa is. So the
                         question is--

               He pockets the last ball, hands the cue to T-Boz.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Do you have Ambition?

               He looks at them all in turn. Cracks a grin.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Start working on those abs guys.
                         You guys look disgusting.

               And with that he leaves. Pinky smiles. She likes this nigga's
               style.



               EXT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING

               SBUJWA NATION are in a full scale rehearsal.

               MUZI dances at the back, learning the routine.

               Shoes looks on.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - EVENING

               The eventide streets kokasi alive with humanity journeying
               home.



               INT. LERATO'S LOUNGE - EVENING

               MUZI walks past, lugging his bag. LERATO and GOGO are
               watching TV. Gogo has her stockinged feet up.

                                   MUZI
                         Hey.

                                   LERATO
                         Hey. What's in the bag?

               Muzi's blank for a second, recovers himself.

                                   MUZI
                         Project stuff. Remember I've got
                         that thing with Thami?

                                   LERATO
                         Ja. How are those accounts looking?
                         It's been weeks now.

                                   MUZI
                         Ja. I'll do them.

                                   LERATO
                         Try and get back earlier tomorrow
                         and work on them before the
                         weekend.

                                   MUZI
                         I'll try.

               He's leaves, bedroom bound. Lerato frowns - she can see Muzi
               isn't telling her everything. Gogo squirms in her seat, eyes
               glued to the screen.

                                   GOGO 
                             (to the TV)
                         Tell her you love her. She can see
                         it muna.
                             (beat)
                         Eish. Useless! Can't even lie
                         properly.

               Lerato gets up and walks away. Gogo is glued to the screen.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - EVENING

               Establishing.



               EXT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING

               The sun is setting outside the warehouse.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING

               THE DANCERS are stretching, getting warmed up. KHANYI and
               MUZI chat on the side.

                                   KHANYI
                         All this time I saw you in school I
                         thought you were just another nerd
                         doing accounting.

                                   MUZI
                         Mara nerds rule the world.

                                   KHANYI
                         Why didn't you ever dance in the
                         talent shows in college?

               Muzi goes blank for a second. SHOES interrupts everyone.

                                   SHOES
                         Okay. Let's get started or else you
                         guys will start complaining about
                         leaving late.
                             (beat)
                         Before I forget. Ora. Take the keys
                         from me when we leave. I might be
                         late tomorrow.

               Ora nods. The other dancers move onto the dance floor. Khanyi
               and Muzi separate.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Okay. So Ora's going to be the new
                         boss.

               Ora can't contain his smile.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Khanyi and Zee will also be up
                         front.

               Khanyi and Zee step forward.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Mara everyone must know that they
                         can become boss at any time. No one
                         here is special. If you work hard
                         for it, you earn it.

               Muzi steps back. Shoes shoots a look at him.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         You know your timer was one of the
                         best bosses I ever saw. We used to
                         win competitions like crazy coz of
                         him.

                                   MUZI
                         Ja. Too bad I'm not him, hey.

                                   ORA
                         Ja, that's just too bad.

               Muzi steps up to his face.

                                   MUZI
                         You have a problem, skaterboy?

               The tension in the room goes from zero to a hundred. Ora
               doesn't flinch, leans into Muzi.

                                   ORA
                         No. Do you?
                             (beat)
                         Go back to your place. At the back.

                                   MUZI
                         Make me.

               Shoes steps between them.

                                   SHOES
                         Okay, okay. Let's get started.

               The two separate, eyeing each other.



               EXT. COLLEGE - DAY (NEW DAY)

               Establishing.



               EXT. COLLEGE GARDEN - DAY

               MUZI walks along with THAMI.

                                   THAMI
                         You know if your mum finds out your
                         dancing again she's going to kill
                         you, right?

                                   MUZI
                         How's she going to find out?

                                   THAMI
                         It's like when you started smoking.
                         How did she find out?

                                   MUZI
                         You left a loose in my bag you
                         idiot!

                                   THAMI
                         So what's it like being in a crew? 

                                   MUZI
                         It sucks bra. There's this pain in
                         the ass guy named Ora.

               A peal of laughter startles them. They turn around to find--

               KHANYI.

                                   KHANYI
                         I can't stand him either.

                                   MUZI
                         Oh, Khanyi. Sorry. I er..

                                   KHANYI
                         Who's your friend?

                                   MUZI
                         Oh. Thami. This is Khanyi. Khanyi,
                         Thami.

               Thami is a bit too quick to give her a tight hug. Khanyi
               hides her surprise with the air of one used to such overt
               displays of masculine affection.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Sorry about what I said about Ora.
                         I didn't know you were--

                                   KHANYI
                         Don't be.

                                   MUZI
                         I thought you and Ora were like,
                         you know...

                                   KHANYI
                         We're not anything. He wishes we
                         were though.

                                   MUZI
                         Ah, ok.

                                   KHANYI
                         Ok.

               Tense silence. Thami watches, wide eyed and grinning.

                                   KHANYI (CONT'D)
                         I think I'd better go.

                                   MUZI
                         I'll see you at rehearsals.

               She smiles and nods, walks away. Thami gawks at Muzi.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         What?

               Thami winks and gives Muzi a heavy pat on the back. Muzi
               splutters and coughs.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               SBUJWA NATION rehearse a dance sequence. 

               ORA, KHANYI and ZEE are at the front row. The other dancers
               follow in the back.

               MUZI does the moves but he makes them much bigger and
               explosive and not contained at all.

                                   SHOES
                         Stop. Stop.

               He stops the music. Everyone stops, breathing hard.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Wena Muzi. What's the problem?

                                   ORA
                         He thinks he's better.

               Muzi's fights back his irritation.

                                   MUZI
                         I'm just giving the moves some life
                         man. When you're battling, if you
                         don't have some --

                                   SHOES
                             (interrupts)
                         We're a crew Muzi. We're no longer
                         battling one on one.

                                   MUZI
                         And the break-outs?

                                   SHOES
                         They come from the crew's sequence.
                         If you don't fit into the sequence,
                         the crew looks bad, and the break
                         outs look kak also. It's all one
                         thing.

               Muzi digests this for a second.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Okay. Let's go again. Contained
                         Muzi. Fit in.

               He turns the music on. Muzi takes a moment to swallow his
               disagreement, then joins in. He spots Ora's smug smile. He
               levels him with a stare then--

               Does the exact same thing as before. For Ora's benefit.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - EVENING

               Evening in a different part of the city. More run down. More
               gritty. More like the place where you'd expect to find--



               INT. CHOP SHOP - EVENING

               We're in a dirty, decrepit chop shop. Musty. Car parts
               everywhere. Rusty equipment. Old tires in the corner. LOUD
               MUSIC PLAYS as we take in--

               Graffiti murals on the wall. Amongst them, standing out in
               red, the letters -- ""A.M.B.I.$.H.N.".  

               In the middle of the room--

               PINKY, PRINCE, T-BOZ, ARNOLD and some other AMBISHN DANCERS
               perform a dance sequence. They're mechanical. Precise.
               Powerful. They're not enjoying themselves. They're not here
               to enjoy themselves.

               AMBISHN DANCER ONE misses a step. 

               PRINCE shouts for them to stop.

                                   PRINCE
                         Hold it!
                             (beat)
                         What the hell is wrong with you?
                         How many times have we been through
                         this?

               AMBISHN DANCER ONE lowers his head.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Voetsek. 

               AMBISHN DANCER ONE doesn't move.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         I said hamba. Get out!

               AMBISHN DANCE shuffles out.

                                   PINKY
                         Mara Prince bafwethu. Chill nyana.

                                   PRINCE
                             (explodes)
                         Shut up. This is my crew. I run it
                         the way I want. Understand?

               PINKY bites back a tear. PRINCE softens, goes up to her.
               Takes her chin in his hand.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry sweetie. I didn't mean it
                         like that. It's just that..

               He turns to the others, face hardened.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         You guys are my family. And family
                         is hard on each other because they
                         want what's best. 

               He looks at Pinky, almost whispering as he takes her chin in
               his hands again.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Hey, Pinky?

               She's afraid. But forces a smile. Prince beams.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Good. You trust me. 

               He looks at Pinky but speaks to the entire crew.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         The Pretoria qualifiers are in two
                         days time people. Let's go again.
                         This time no mess ups. 

               They line up and 

               --BEGIN their dance sequence.

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY (NEW DAY)

               SBUJWA NATION finish a dance sequence. Shoes stops the music.

                                   SHOES
                         Cool. We'll stop there. 

               The dancers make a beeline for their water bottles and
               towels.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         So guys please remember to come
                         with some new stuff tomorrow. Then
                         we can see where we can add it.

               The dancers nod their agreement, start streaming out.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Muzi. Do you have a minute?

               Muzi throws a questioning glance at him.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         There's something I want to show
                         you.

               He goes off to his bag in the corner. Muzi follows him. Shoes
               rummages in his bag for a second, emerges with a VHS tape in
               hand.

                                   MUZI
                         What's that?

                                   SHOES
                         It's a tape we made. Of your
                         father's. The last moves he came up
                         with before he-- passed. 

               Shoes hands it to Muzi.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         He never got a chance to perform
                         them in public.

               He zips up his bag.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         I've never been able to watch it.
                         But maybe you --

                                   ORA
                         I don't believe this...

               Shoes and Muzi spin around to find ORA standing behind them.

                                   ORA (CONT'D)
                         So you refuse to let us watch it
                         then you give it to him?

                                   SHOES
                         I thought you'd left.

                                   ORA
                         I was returning your keys.

               He tosses them at Shoes's feet. 

                                   SHOES
                         This tape belonged to his father.
                         He has a right to see it.

                                   ORA
                         Prince was right.

                                   SHOES
                         What the hell does that mean?

                                   ORA  
                         This is just a hobby for you.

                                   SHOES
                         You don't know what the hell you're
                         saying.

               Ora stews in his anger for second, storms off. Muzi turns to
               Shoes.

                                   MUZI   
                         Why's this tape such a big deal? 

               Shoes regards him for a long moment before he breaks the
               silence.

                                   SHOES   
                         After your father passed. I quit
                         dancing. But more than anything I
                         wanted to keep kids off the
                         streets.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

               TITLE: "Seven years earlier."

               A younger SHOES is teaching TEENAGERS to do Sbujwa in his
               warehouse.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         I found this place and started
                         teaching kids sbujwa.

               ON PRINCE. 17 years old. In the front row. A natural at this.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         I could see even then that Prince
                         was born to dance. He was going to
                         become one of the best. Maybe even
                         as good as your father.
                             (beat)
                         He reminded me so much of him.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

               Shoes alone with Prince. Watches as Prince dances. Barks out
               mute orders.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         So I pushed him real hard. 
                             (beat)
                         When he finished matric he needed a
                         place to stay. I let him move in
                         with me.



               INT. SHOES'S KITCHEN - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

               SHOES and PRINCE share a meal. A starved Prince digs in.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         He had no family. His mother had
                         passed away a few years before I
                         met him.
                             (beat)
                         He never knew his father. I felt I
                         owed it to him. He needed a break
                         in life.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

               TITLE: "Three years earlier."

               An older PRINCE watches a GROUP OF SKHOTANES dancing around a
               fire.

                                   SHOES
                         But he never knew what family
                         meant. It was always about him. 
                             (beat)
                         I guess it wasn't his fault.

               Prince looks at the Skhothanes, enamoured. The leaping orange
               flames glimmer in his dark eyes.

               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET - DAY

               PRINCE is with the TEENAGERS from earlier. He hands them a
               small white baggie. They hand him some notes.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         He started selling drugs to support
                         his lifestyle.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

               Prince with the GROUP OF SKHOTANES. Pouring ultra mel on the
               fire. The SMALL CROWD OF ONLOOKERS cheers him.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         But even that wasn't enough. He
                         wanted to show the world that he
                         was different. That he was special.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

               PRINCE and SHOES arguing.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         He wanted to see Spikiri's tape.
                         But I said no. I didn't want him to
                         insult your father's memory, using
                         his moves the way he wanted.
                             (beat)
                         After that, it was never the same
                         between us.

               Prince slowly fades away--

               END FLASHBACK.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - (PRESENT DAY)

               -- And MUZI fades up, standing in the same spot. Shoes hands
               him the tape.

                                   SHOES
                         This is yours. 

               Muzi stares at the tape.

                                   MUZI
                         Keep it. 
                             (beat)
                         I'll do my own moves. My own way.

               He wheels around, walks away. Shoes watches him go,
               disappointment on his face.



               EXT. FIELD OF DREAMS - DAY - (DREAM SEQUENCE)

               The sun rises over the field of dreams.



               EXT. FIELD OF DREAMS - DAY - (DREAM SEQUENCE)

               MUZI, nine years old, is in a garden with SPIKIRI, mid
               twenties.

               The tableau is a replica in motion of the still photo that
               Muzi was looking at earlier.

               Spikiri grabs Muzi and lifts Muzi up high. Muzi squeals in
               delight.

               END DREAM SEQUENCE.



               INT. MUZI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               MUZI's eye snaps open.

               He peers into the darkness, the sound of his and his father's
               laughter lingers, haunting him. 



               EXT. TOWNSHIP - NIGHT

               The township lies in peaceful slumber, serenaded by the
               chirping crickets.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - EVENING (NEW DAY)

               Establishing.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING

               The Sbujwa Nation Dancers are getting warmed up. ORA struts
               in. Spots Muzi and Khanyi laughing in the corner. He frowns.

                                   ORA
                             (raises his voice)
                         Shoes is running late, so I'm in
                         charge.

                                   KHANYI
                         Wow! Someone woke up on the wrong
                         side of the bed.

                                   ORA
                         Everyone's talking about how
                         Ambishn destroyed guys in Pretoria.
                         We're up against serious
                         competition. We've got to up our
                         game.

               He walks up to the sound system, plugs in his phone. 

                                   ORA (CONT'D)
                         Okay. We'll start with track three.
                         Two sets of eight. Jump to track
                         one. One set. Then track four. One
                         set. Usual stuff.

               Muzi and the other dancers nod and stand in their positions.
               Muzi goes to the back.

                                   ORA (CONT'D)
                         Muzi, it's fine. You can sit this
                         one out.

                                   MUZI
                         What?

                                   ORA
                         Just watch so you don't mess us up.
                         Then you can show us if you've
                         learnt anything. 
                             (condescending)
                         We'll see how special you really
                         are.

               Muzi closes the gap between them fast, presses his chest
               against Ora.

                                   MUZI
                         Like hell.

                                   ORA
                         I said sit down.

                                   MUZI
                         Why don't you make me?

               Ora pushes him. Muzi gives him a shove and Ora tumbles to the
               ground. He's back on his feet in an instant, charges at Muzi.
               The other dancers separate them.

                                   ZEE
                         Chill bafwethu.

                                   KHANYI
                         What the hell is wrong with you
                         guys?

                                   ORA
                         He started it. He's jealous coz I'm
                         boss.

                                   KHANYI
                         You're so full of shit, Ora.

               She packs up her bags and leaves. The other dancers follow
               suit.

                                   ORA
                         Hey! Guys. Come back. Guys?

               Muzi glares at him, turns and leaves with the others.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - NIGHT

               MUZI, KHANYI, ORA, ZEE and the other dancers walk along in
               silence. Khanyi peels away.

                                   KHANYI
                         I'm meeting my sister in Gandhi
                         Square. I'll see you tomorrow.

                                   MUZI
                         Hey, I'll come with you. I'm going
                         there too.

               She smiles. They walk off together. Ora watches them go,
               furrows his brow in frustration. Zee shakes his head, goes
               off alone.



               ** SCENE DELETED**



               EXT. GANDHI SQUARE - NIGHT

               KHANYI and MUZI stand waiting. Khanyi checks her phone.

                                   MUZI
                         What's she saying?

                                   KHANYI
                         No lift. She's running late. Damn.
                         Now I've got to walk to the taxis.

                                   MUZI
                         It's cool. I'll walk you.

                                   KHANYI
                         Thanks.

               They head off together.

                         This means I'll have to cook when I
                         get home. My sister's useless, hey.

                                   MUZI
                         And your mum?

                                   KHANYI
                         We don't live with her.



               EXT. MARSHALLTOWN - NIGHT

               KHANYI and MUZI walk along eating an ice-cream.

                                   KHANYI  
                         My mom married this guy and we sort
                         of don't get along, so, ja.

                                   MUZI  
                         And your dad?

               She rolls her eyes.

                                   MUZI  (CONT'D)
                         Sorry.

                                   KHANYI  
                         Anyway, me and my sister moved out.
                         It's better than always fighting
                         with my step dad and his kids.
                             (beat)
                         Are you hungry?



               INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Muzi eats, and Khanyi gazes at him. It's disconcerting.

                                   MUZI
                         What?

                                   KHANYI
                         Nothing.

               She keeps staring at him.

                                   MUZI
                         What? Is it something in my teeth?

                                   KHANYI
                         What was it like being the son of a
                         world famous pantsula dancer?

               Muzi puts his burger down - he's lost his appetite.

                                   KHANYI (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry I asked.

                                   MUZI
                         At least you didn't ask if I saw
                         him using the drugs. Or if he gave
                         them to me as a kid. Or if I used
                         them when I used to dance with him
                         back in the day.

                                   KHANYI
                         Do people ask you that?

                                   MUZI
                         Yup. And those are the decent ones.
                             (beat, changing topic)
                         Are you in a hurry? I wanna show
                         you something really cool.



               EXT. JOBURG BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               KHANYI and MUZI seated beside each other gazing out at the
               breathtaking sight beneath them - the shimmering Joburg
               cityscape bathed in nocturnal light.

                                   KHANYI
                         Wow!

                                   MUZI
                         Cool, hey.

               They gaze at the sight for a moment. Khanyi opens her bag and
               takes out a couple of DVDs, gives them to Muzi.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         What's this?

                                   KHANYI
                         You're a great dancer. And I know
                         it's tough being in a crew when
                         you've been solo all these years.
                         You just need to contain your moves
                         a bit better. Watch these DVDs.
                         It's our videos since last year.
                         Maybe they'll help.

               Muzi hesitates. Sees the genuine look in her eyes. He takes
               them.

                                   MUZI
                         Thanks.

               They both smile, kind of embarrassed. 

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         The sky is so clear from up here,
                         isn't it.

               Khanyi nods. They gaze up into the nigrescent sky, as the
               city scape beneath them fades into--



               EXT. JOBURG BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY

               Daytime.



               ****SCENE DELETED****



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - DAY

               Taxis. People. Cars. Noise. Pollution. A typical day in
               Africa's largest metropolis.



               EXT. METRO RAIL STATION - DAY

               We're outside a metro rail station.

               MUZI and THAMI are walk towards the turnstile.

                                   THAMI
                         Mfana she wants your beef. 

                                   MUZI  
                         Please man. I wish. There's like a
                         thousand guys chasing after her.

                                   THAMI  
                         She paid for the food, bra. Do you
                         even understand what that means?

                                   MUZI
                         It wasn't a date. It was--

               A GROUP of about EIGHT HOODLUMS, all wearing full body length
               pieces with a skeleton design, surround them.

               The Hoodlums block the entrance to the metro rail and --

               Break into a well coordinated SBUJWA DANCE SEQUENCE. 

               One of them sprays a stencil on the wall: "A.M.B.I.$.H.N.".
               Another films them with his cellphone camera.

               ON the lead dancer's dark eyes. He spots Muzi.

               He breaks out into a solo, ending right up in Muzi's face.
               Muzi recognises him at that close range.

               PRINCE.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Nice one, Prince. I can see you've
                         been taking some classes somewhere.

               Prince leans into Muzi, breathes into his face.

                                   PRINCE
                         Let's do it. Right here. Right now.

               Thami steps between them.

                                   THAMI
                         Bafwethu. Relax. You can't just
                         battle out here just nje. That's
                         dumb.
                             (beat)
                         Let's put some money down first.

               A SHRILL whistle breaks up the moment. TWO SECURITY GUARDS
               come running up. The Hoodlums scatter. Prince leans into
               Muzi. 

                                   PRINCE  
                         You can't even dance in a crew.
                         You're a disgrace to your father.
                         You don't deserve to carry his
                         surname.

               Muzi levels him with a stare.

                                   MUZI
                         At least I know who my father is.

               Prince shoves Muzi to the ground. Muzi gets up in an instant,
               rearing to fight. Thami holds them apart.

                                   THAMI
                         Gents. Remember we're all in the
                         same team here, hey. We're fighting
                         for the good of sbujwa, neh gents?

                                   PRINCE
                         Don't ever say me and him are the
                         same.
                             (to Muzi)
                         You had everything. I had nothing.
                         You and me can never be the same.

               Muzi is bewildered. The Security guards close in. Prince
               leans over Muzi.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         This isn't over.

               He runs off. Muzi and Thami step back to let the Security
               Guards run past, whistles blowing shrilly.

                                   THAMI
                         That guy's got some serious issues.
                             (beat)
                         And bad breath too.
                             (beat)
                         Mint?

               He offers Muzi a mint. Muzi's worried frown obviates the need
               for a response.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - DAY

               We're back in the organized chaos of the township.

               Establishing.



               INT. SHOES'S KITCHEN - DAY

               MUZI barges in. SHOES looks up from doing the dishes in the
               sink, surprised.

                                   SHOES
                         Hey muna. You must knock first?
                         What if there was a woman in here?

                                   MUZI
                         What the hell is wrong with that
                         guy?

               Shoes sits down.

                                   SHOES
                         Who?

                                   MUZI
                         Prince. What did I ever do to him?

               Shoes stands up, crosses over to the fridge.

                                   SHOES
                         What happened?

                                   MUZI
                         He's following me around making
                         threats now. All because of some
                         silly competition?

               Shoes falls silent.

                                   SHOES
                         It's not silly.

               Muzi scrutinizes him.

                                   MUZI
                         There's something you're not
                         telling me.

               Shoes gets up.

                                   SHOES
                         Aren't you supposed to be in
                         college? 

                                   MUZI
                         You said if I joined your crew
                         you'd tell me the truth.

               Shoes shakes his head, sips his drink.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Or were you lying just to get me
                         in?

                                   SHOES
                         I have never lied to you Muzi.

                                   MUZI
                         Then tell me what Prince's beef is.

               Shoes sips his drink, reticent.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Okay, I'm enough with this crap.
                             (beat)
                         I'm not so stupid that I can't see
                         when I'm being used.

               Muzi grabs his bag and leaves.

                                   SHOES
                         Muzi!

                                   MUZI
                         Tell Ora I'll be sitting out the
                         rehearsals today. That should make
                         him happy.

                         Muzi!

               He turns around. KHANYI hurries to catch up.

                                   KHANYI (CONT'D)
                         You didn't come through yesterday.
                         Shoes was pissed.

                                   MUZI

                                   PRINCE
                         Ambition is like a month old. And
                         already we're the (bleep). We
                         already made it through to Hear Me
                         Move repping Tshwane y'all. And
                         we're going to win it. America, get
                         ready.

                                   NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
                         Wow! That's very...ambitious. Any
                         message for your fans?

                                   PRINCE  
                         No. But I've got one for Sbujwa
                         Nation.

               He leans into the camera, menacing. Lowers his shades.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         You were jealous of me so you
                         kicked me out. Well guess what?

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING

               KHANYI, ZEE, ORA, SHOES and the other dancers are gathered
               around Khanyi's phone, watching the rest of the Prince
               interview.

               CELL PHONE FOOTAGE.

               Prince speaks into the camera.

                                   PRINCE
                         Ambishn is the best crew Mzansi's
                         ever seen. And if Sbujwa Nation
                         think they're worth anything, they
                         can come and verse us at Toe To Toe
                         when they film at our place next
                         week. You know where that is,
                         right?

               He bursts out laughing.

               ON Khanyi, Zee, Ora, Shoes and the others.

               The tension is palpable.

                                   ZEE
                         I'm not scared of Prince. Let's
                         take him out.

                                   SHOES
                         Since when does Prince tell us what
                         to do?

                                   ZEE
                         But if we don't go we look like
                         cowards.

                                   KHANYI
                         He's challenged us on the Internet.
                         Everyone knows about it. It's
                         already got like a million views.

               There's silence. Everyone knows Khanyi's right.

                                   SHOES
                         I still say we mustn't go.

                                   KHANYI
                         What choice do we have? 

               He looks around the room. It's split - some are for him some
               are against him. 

                                   ORA
                         Let's vote.

               Murmurs of approval.

                                   KHANYI
                         Wait. Everyone's not here. 

                                   ORA
                         Muzi knows what time rehearsals
                         start. Let's vote.

               Shoes frowns, frustrated. Tension mounts.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - DAY (NEW DAY)

               A new day in the township.



               INT./EXT. LERATO'S SPAZA SHOP - DAY

               It's evening outside Lerato's Spaza Shop. Shoes walks up to
               the counter and knocks. Lerato appears - she's surprised to
               see him. 

                                   SHOES
                         Legai ma. 

                                   LERATO
                         Shoes! 
                             (beat)
                         So you've finally come to visit
                         after all these years.

                                   SHOES
                             (abashed)
                         Ja, I should've come sooner.

                                   LERATO
                         You still look like a boy.

               Shoes smiles, embarrassed. Uncomfortable silence.

                                   SHOES
                         Is Muzi here?

                                   LERATO
                         No.

               More silence. She spins around and enters the house.

                                   LERATO (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                         Muzi! You have a visitor. It's your
                         Uncle Shoes.

               Muzi appears. He stops - surprised to see Shoes. 

                                   SHOES
                         We need to talk.

               Lerato looms up behind Muzi.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         In private.

               Muzi exchanges a tense look with Lerato. She's not happy at
               all. He steps out--

               And walks a few paces away with Shoes. 

               -- Lerato looks on.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         You heard about Prince?

                                   MUZI
                         Everyone's seen the video.

                                   SHOES
                         The others are going.

                                   MUZI
                         Good for them.

                                   SHOES
                         What the hell is that supposed to
                         mean?

                                   MUZI
                         It's not my battle. 

               Muzi turns to go. Shoes grabs his elbow and jerks him around,
               his face dark with fury, breathing hard. Muzi gulps - he's
               never seen Shoes like this.

                                   SHOES
                         You've tried so hard to not be like
                         your father that you've ended up
                         just like him.

               Muzi's face hardens - demanding an explanation.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         He was always shit scared of facing 
                         his responsibilities. So he'd run
                         away. He was always running away.

                                   MUZI
                         I'm not my father. This has nothing
                         to do with --

                                   SHOES
                             (interrupts)
                         And you want to know why he kept
                         running away. It wasn't because he
                         was afraid of failing. No.
                             (beat)
                         He was afraid of succeeding.
                         Because that's much harder.

               Muzi is stung.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         You want to know the truth?
                             (beat)
                         Your father and Prince's mother--
                             (beat)
                         He could be your brother. That's
                         why I took him in. That's why I
                         looked after him.
                             (beat)
                         And that's why he hates you. You
                         had everything. And he had nothing.
                         Not even a father's surname. So ja.
                         This is your battle.

               Shoes strides away. Muzi is dumbstruck.



               INT. LERATO'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               MUZI, GOGO and LERATO are seated at table having dinner. Muzi
               is playing with his food.

                                   GOGO
                         What's wrong Muzi?

                                   MUZI
                         Nothing Gogo.

                                   LERATO
                         How's your project going? 

                                   MUZI
                         Well.

                                   LERATO
                         Is that why you've been coming home
                         early?

               Muzi doesn't answer.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         Are you going to tell me what's
                         wrong or are you just going to sit
                         there with a long face.

                                   MUZI
                         Did Pa have other children?

               Lerato and Gogo exchange a glance. This came from nowhere.

                                   LERATO
                         Muzi I told you already. Let it go.

                                   MUZI
                         No I'm not letting go. You've never
                         told me anything about him. All I
                         hear are rumours and stories from
                         other people. I don't even know
                         what happened the night he died. Do
                         you think that's fair?

               Gogo clears her throat, picks up the plate and disappears.

                                   LERATO
                         Your father was stabbed to death at
                         a party, Muzi. It happens all the
                         time if you live the way he did. 

                                   MUZI
                         And the drugs?

                                   LERATO
                         They found them on him. They said
                         he used them when dancing. You know
                         all this Muzi.

                                   MUZI
                         Did they do a test?

                                   LERATO
                         What?

                                   MUZI
                         A test. Did they do a test?

                                   LERATO
                         You can go and ask the police. It
                         was twelve years ago. Good luck
                         with that.

               She gets up, pauses at the door, softens.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         Muzi. Your father may not have been
                         the best man on earth. I've
                         accepted that. So should you.
                             (beat)
                         You look tired. Go to sleep.

               She leaves. Muzi stares straight ahead of him, statuesque.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - EVENING (NEW DAY)

               Establishing.



               INT. SHOES'S WAREHOUSE - EVENING

               The SBUJWA NATION dancers are warming up, stretching,
               changing.

               MUZI walks in. Stares meet him as he walks towards--

               ORA, KHANYI and ZEE.

                                   MUZI
                         I'm coming to Toe to Toe.

                                   ORA
                         You quit on us.

                                   MUZI
                         I've changed my mind.

                                   ORA
                         It makes no difference.

               Muzi scowls. SHOES walks into the room, unobserved.

                                   ORA (CONT'D)
                         You've been messing around in
                         practice. You don't know the moves.
                         You can't fit in with the rest of
                         the crew. 
                             (beat)
                         You'll make us look bad.

               Muzi turns to the others.

                                   MUZI
                         Is that how you all feel?

               He looks around the room. The rest meet his gaze, defiant.
               Khanyi looks away.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Fine.

               He storms off. There's a stony silence.

                                   ORA
                         Let's get started. We don't have a
                         lot of time.



               EXT. FLYOVER - EVENING

               We're underneath a flyover. It's dark. Music plays off a
               small music system.

               MUZI dances alone. Angry. Frustrated. Humiliated and ashamed.
               Taking out all this negativity in a POWERFUL SBUJWA DANCE
               SEQUENCE.

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. PRINCE'S CHOP SHOP - EVENING

               PRINCE dances alone. Controlled. Mechanical. Precise.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. FLYOVER - EVENING

               Muzi works up a sweat. Panting for breath now. Closes his
               eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. FIELD OF DREAMS - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE)

               Nine year old MUZI with SPIKIRI. Spikiri lifts the boy up
               high in the air, Muzi screams in excitement. Spikiri turns
               him over into a cartwheel. Muzi shrieks - afraid.

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. PRINCE'S CHOP SHOP - EVENING

               Tears stream down Prince's face as he gives himself over to
               the motion.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. FLYOVER - EVENING

               Muzi slows down, exhaustion setting in.

               The music stops. Muzi looks up, surprised. 

                                   SHOES
                         That's your problem right there.

               SHOES steps out of the shadows.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         You're always feeling the moves.
                         And that's great. But it's too
                         much. You've got to learn to
                         control them.

                                   MUZI
                             (panting)
                         I've been dancing like this all my
                         life.

                                   SHOES
                         Because you've been dancing solo.
                         But if you want to learn how to
                         dance in a crew, you've got to
                         learn to dance like the crew.

               Muzi pants, catching his breath and trying to wrap his head
               around what Shoes is saying.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         I can teach you.
                             (beat)
                         If you are ready.

               Muzi weighs the decision.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Are you?

               Muzi snaps around, strides to --

               The music system. He presses play. House beats shake the
               space.

               Determination is etched in every line on Muzi's face, in
               every bead of sweat.

                                   MUZI
                         Let's do this.

               Shoes smiles.

               The music continues over the following--

          SERIES OF SHOTS.



               VIDEO FOOTAGE: 

               SBUJWA NATION dancing. 

                                                                CUT TO:



               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The footage plays off a laptop screen.

               MUZI watches the screen as he imitates the moves. SHOES looks
               on.

               Muzi does the moves, bigger and better. Same way he did them
               before.

                                   SHOES
                         Your hands are all over the place.

               Muzi contains his hands.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         No. I didn't say get stiff.



               EXT. WAREHOUSE - EVENING (NEW DAY)

               Muzi stands clandestine outside the warehouse. 

               He watches the Sbujwa Nation dancers leave the warehouse. 

               As soon as the coast is clear, Shoes motions to him to join
               him.

               Muzi runs into the warehouse.



               VIDEO FOOTAGE: SBUJWA NATION

               -- Doing a different sequence - more legs based.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The laptop screen. MUZI imitates the moves. Shoes looks on,
               sipping a beer.

                                   SHOES
                         Save the energy for the break-outs.
                         That's when you can really go big.

          END SERIES OF SHOTS.



               EXT. WAREHOUSE - MORNING (NEW DAY)

               Sunrise.



               EXT. FYLOVER - MORNING

               MUZI feet throw up clouds of dust.  His fluid motions cut
               through the dawn light.

               SHOES looks on, impressed.

                                   SHOES
                         That's it. It looks better when
                         it's disciplined.

                                   MUZI
                         Film it!

               Shoes takes out his phone and starts recording. Muzi breaks
               out of the sequence and--

               Leaps onto a garbage can, throws himself into a triple back
               flip. His powerful figure silhoutted by the golden rays of
               the sun.

               He lands on his feet, throwing up a cloud of dust, looks up,
               smiling.

                                   SHOES
                         What the hell was that?

                                   MUZI
                         Saving energy for the break-out.

               Shoes shakes his head. Can't help but smile.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               MUZI takes a gulp of water. Shoes watches the video.

                                   MUZI
                         How is it?

                                   SHOES
                         Not bad.

                                   MUZI
                         Not bad?

               Muzi snaps the water bottle shut, crosses over to Shoes and
               takes the phone.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         You think they'll let me dance with
                         them?

                                   SHOES
                         It's worth a shot. Go home and get
                         cleaned up. You don't have much
                         time.

                                   MUZI
                         Aren't you coming?

               Shoes shakes his head.

                                   SHOES
                         I still think it's a bad idea to
                         let Prince tell you what to do.

               He puts a reassuring hand on Muzi's shoulder.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         But I'll be watching.
                             (beat)
                         This is your battle.

               Muzi nods - determined.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - DAY

               Muzi walks along the street, phone to his ear.

                                   MUZI
                             (into phone)
                         Khanyi. Hey. I'm coming to the
                         studio. Where's it at?

                                   KHANYI (O.S.)
                         You're what?

                                   MUZI
                             (into phone)
                         I said I'm coming to Toe To Toe.
                         Where do I have to be?

                                   KHANYI (O.S.)
                         It's the studio in Randburg.
                             (beat)
                         Listen are you really coming?

                                   MUZI
                             (into phone)
                         Yeah. I know you guys don't trust
                         me and all but that's going to
                         change.
                             (beat)
                         See you now.

               He hangs up and smiles.



               INT. LERATO'S LOUNGE - DAY

               MUZI walks into the lounge looking all cleaned up, combing
               his hair. He stops dead in his tracks.

               LERATO stands there - an imposing statue blocking his way -
               watching the videos on Muzi's cellphone.

               Muzi gulps. Lerato's eyes flare out at him.

                                   LERATO
                         What's this?

               Muzi is silent. Lerato's voice trembles with suppressed
               emotion.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         You promised me, Muzi. 

               Muzi doesn't know what to say. Lerato's rage crescendoes.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         You promised me you wouldn't dance
                         anymore. You promised me you'd
                         focus on school. 
                             (shouting)
                         You said you would become someone
                         in life and not be like your
                         father. 

               She holds up the phone.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         What's this Muzi?

               Muzi is tongue-tied.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         How long has this been going on?

                                   MUZI
                         It's no big deal ma, really I--

               Lerato sits. She can't believe what she's hearing.

                                   LERATO
                         Muzi, you know what happened to
                         your father. You know why I don't
                         want you to dance. Now you want to
                         go down the same route?

               ON Muzi. Tortured.

                                   MUZI
                         I have to go, Ma.

               Lerato shoots to her feet in an apoplexy of rage.

                                   LERATO
                             (shouting)
                         You're not going anywhere. I've had
                         it with your lies, Muzi. You're
                         going to sit here and you're going
                         to finish the accounts.

               She turns to leave.

                                   MUZI
                         I'm a grown man, ma.

               She turns back.

                                   LERATO
                         Then act like it. You've been lying
                         to me for weeks telling me about a
                         project with Thami. You think I
                         couldn't tell? 

               She tosses the phone on the table.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         You say you're a man. Okay. Fine.
                         I've done my part. You want to
                         throw your life away like your
                         father, that's fine. But this shop
                         is putting food on your table.
                         You're not going anywhere until you
                         finish the accounts.

               She storms off. Muzi starts to speak, thinks better of it. He
               tosses his bag down and grabs the ledger and receipt book off
               the shelf.



               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               OB Van parked outside. Metal railings. A sign - "Silence.
               Filming In Progress." A bored SECURITY GUARD sits by the
               entrance.



               INT. CHOP SHOP - DAY

               We drift past a sign "TOE 2 TOE". 

               Cameras. Lights. Crew. The "Jika Ma Jika" or "Step Up Or Step
               Out" setup. 

               STUDIO AUDIENCE MEMBERS stand behind the iron mesh, screaming
               their heads off.

                                   CELEBRITY MC
                         Welcome to Toe To Toe Street
                         Battle. Last week we took it to the
                         Reptiles. The week before was at
                         Freeze Frame's. And this week, we
                         are rocking it with Ambishn in a
                         secret venue where they and Sbujwa
                         Nation will go--

               The STUDIO AUDIENCE MEMBERS shouts - "Toe to Toe."



               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               PRINCE takes out a baggie. Scoops some dope onto his
               fingernail and sniffs it. Passes the baggie to T-BOZ and
               ARNOLD and the other A.M.B.I.$.H.N. dancers. They do the
               same.

               Prince leads them out.



               INT. CHOP SHOP - DAY

               SBUJWA NATION do a SBUJWA DANCE ROUTINE. The same routine
               that they were doing at rehearsals.

               A.M.B.I.$.H.N. stand on the sidelines. They watch with a
               sneer on their faces.

               The STUDIO AUDIENCE MEMBERS cheer. The CELEBRITY M.C.
               watches, excited.

                                   CELEBRITY MC
                         Three, two, one...

               A.M.B.I.$.H.N. burst onto the stage. They do the exact same
               sequence that Sbujwa Nation did.

               Only better.

               ON:

               KHANYI, ORA, ZEE and the OTHERS. 

               Bewildered.



               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               MUZI hurries up to the door. The SECURITY GUARD blocks his
               way. 

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                         Sorry. No entry. Filming in
                         progress.

                                   MUZI
                         I'm one of the dancers.

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                         Sorry. 

               Muzi tries to push past him - the guard blocks his way. 

                                   SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                         Chief. I said no entry.

               Muzi tosses his bag down in frustration.



               INT. CHOP SHOP - DAY

               A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Complete their sequence.

                                   CELEBRITY MC
                         Three, two, one.

               The STUDIO AUDIENCE MEMBERS cheer A.M.B.I.$.H.N. off stage.

                                   CELEBRITY MC (CONT'D)
                         Audience. They have gone--

               The STUDIO AUDIENCE MEMBERS reply with a chorus - "Toe to
               Toe".

                                   CELEBRITY MC (CONT'D)
                         And the winner is--

               The STUDIO AUDIENCE MEMBERS scream "Ambishn."

               A.M.B.I.$.H.N. are ecstatic.

                                   CELEBRITY MC (CONT'D)
                         There can be no doubt about that.
                         Ambition are this week's winners of
                         Toe To Toe!

               PRINCE sneers at ORA, KHANYI and ZEE.



               EXT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY

               The doors slide open and MUZI watches the STUDIO AUDIENCE
               MEMBERS stream out. He spots--

               The A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members - on cloud nine. High fiving each
               other. 

               Muzi's face falls. He realizes what just happened. He feels a
               pair of eyes burning into him and turns around to see--

               PRINCE. He locks eyes with Muzi. It's a death stare. Loaded
               moment - a portent of what's to come.

                                   ARNOLD
                         Prince. Let's go man.

               The moment is broken. Prince slithers away grudgingly, his
               eyes leaving an unspoken warning for Muzi. 

               Next time.

                                   KHANYI
                         Thanks for being there for your
                         crew, Muzi.

               MUZI snaps out of his reverie and spins around to find--

               KHANYI, ORA, ZEE and the OTHER SBUJWA NATION members behind
               him.

                                   KHANYI (CONT'D)
                         They killed us.

               Muzi is totally confused.

                                   MUZI
                         I got delayed at home. I was on my
                         way, promise.

               Khanyi starts to walk away.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         What? Back up. How is it my fault?
                         You guys didn't even want me to--

               Khanyi spins around, angry.

                                   KHANYI
                         Don't you get it? You let your crew
                         down, Muzi. You let us down in the
                         rehearsals. You let us down today.
                         It's over.

               Muzi is stumped.

                                   ORA
                         Let's go, Khanyi.

               Khanyi starts to leave again.

                                   MUZI
                         Hey hold up! I've busted my balls
                         these last two days learning all
                         the moves. I've got them down. Ask
                         Shoes.

                                   ORA
                         Yeah like we'll really need them
                         now.

                                   MUZI
                         What the hell is that supposed to
                         mean?

                                   ORA
                         We're not going to Hear Me Move.

                                   ZEE
                         Hey. We didn't decide that for
                         sure.

                                   ORA
                         What makes you think we'll beat
                         them a week from now, hey?

               Muzi can't reply. Ora and Zee turn and trudge away, following
               Khanyi. 

               Muzi is a portrait of defeat.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - DAY

               Establishing. Taxis. Busy streets. Lots of noise.

               KHANYI, ORA and ZEE disembark from a taxi. They're all
               forlorn, no one says anything. They go off in different
               directions. 

               Ora watches Khanyi go, thinks for a beat. He chases after
               her.

                                   ORA
                         Khanyi. Lemme walk with you..

                                   KHANYI
                         I'm good thanks.

               She walks off. Ora is not to be put off. He follows.

                                   ORA
                         I was thinking maybe would could
                         grab something to eat?

               Khanyi stops, turns to face him with an air of finality.

                                   KHANYI
                         Ora, you're a great guy and all.
                         But this is never going to work.

               Ora's face darkens.

                                   ORA
                         You still like him, don't you? Even
                         after he let the whole crew down?

                                   KHANYI
                         This has nothing to do with Muzi.

                                   ORA
                         Who said anything about Muzi?

               He spins around and stalks away, bitterness etched on his
               face. 



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - DAY

               We're back in the township.



               INT. LERATO'S SPAZA SHOP - DAY

               MUZI storms in and drops his bag, on the warpath. 

                                   MUZI
                         Thanks for making me late.

               LERATO looks up from stacking loaves of bread on the counter.

                                   LERATO
                         What?

                                   MUZI
                         You made me late for the
                         competition.

                                   LERATO
                         Listen wena. I don't care how old
                         you are. I'm your mother you're not
                         going to speak to me like that.

                                   MUZI
                         All my life, I've only wanted one
                         thing. Just one thing. And you
                         won't even let me have it.

               Lerato is stung.

                                   LERATO
                         I have looked after you all your
                         life. I raised you by myself. I
                         carried you for nine months Muzi. I
                         want what is best for you.

                                   MUZI
                         What about what I want?

               Lerato is bewildered - she can't believe she's hearing this -
               retreats into defence mode.

                                   LERATO
                         Muzi, as long as your under my roof
                         -

                                   MUZI
                         Keep your damn roof.

                                   LERATO
                             (splutters)
                         What?

               He grabs his bag and storms out. 

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         Muzi! Where are you going? Muzi!

               Muzi's out of there. Gone. Lerato bites her lip, tears
               welling up in her eyes. She breaks down and sobs.



               EXT. SHOES'S HOUSE - EVENING

               A hand KNOCKS on the door. Pulls back.

                                   SHOES (O.C.)
                         Ja ja ja.

               The door opens and Shoes looks out at--

               MUZI. Standing there. Bag in his hands. Head dropped.

               And Shoes just looks at him.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - EVENING

               Establishing. ORA skateboards down the streets.



               EXT. PRINCE'S CHOP SHOP - EVENING

               ORA picks up his skateboard and walks in.



               INT. PRINCE'S CHOP SHOP - EVENING

               The A.M.B.I.$.H.N. dancers have celebratory drinks. Music
               plays. ORA walks in. A.M.B.I.$.H.N. snap to attention, wolves
               ready for the kill. The music dies.

                                   T-BOZ
                         What do you want?

                                   ORA
                         I'm looking for Prince.

                                   ARNOLD
                         Voetsek.

                                   PRINCE
                         Let him speak.

               PRINCE looms up from the back, approaches Ora. Nods at him,
               giving him permission to speak. Ora takes a deep breath.

                                   ORA
                         I...I want to join Ambishn.

               The A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Dancers burst out laughing.

                                   PRINCE
                         Why?

                                   ORA
                         Coz I'm a damn good dancer. And I
                         want to be at Hear Me Move with a
                         winning crew.

                                   PRINCE
                         Our worst is better than you.

               Ora glances around, thinking fast.

                                   ORA
                         I can help you beat Sbujwa Nation.

                                   ARNOLD
                         We've beaten them already. They're
                         not going to rock up at Hear Me
                         Move.

                                   ORA
                         That's what you think.

                                   PRINCE
                         What do you mean?

               Ora pauses, deliberates.

                                   ORA
                         Shoes gave Muzi the tape.

               Prince grabs Ora's collar and almost lifts him off the
               ground.

                                   PRINCE
                         What?

                                   ORA
                             (panicky)
                         The tape he refused to give you. 
                         He gave it to Muzi. I saw him. I
                         swear.

               Prince shoves Ora to the floor. Ora gets up, dusts himself
               off.

                                   ORA (CONT'D)
                         Let me join you guys. Please. I'm
                         tired of Sbujwa Nation.

               Prince regards him with condescension.

                                   PRINCE
                         You're pathetic. My weenie's got
                         more swag than you. Voetsek.

               Ora is bewildered, hangs back.

                                   ORA
                         Please.

               Arnold looms up, threatening. He grabs Ora's skateboard.

                                   ARNOLD
                         Voetsek!

               Ora hurries out, embarrassed. Prince watches him go, a deep
               furrow on his brow. Dark thoughts cross his mind.

                                   PINKY
                         I think we should've kept him
                         close.

                                   PRINCE
                         Shut up! I do the thinking. You
                         just stand there and look pretty.

               He walks out. Pinky bites back her hurt.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - NIGHT

               It's evening. The township buzz on the streets is slowly
               dying down.



               INT. LERATO'S LOUNGE - NIGHT

               LERATO stares at the TV with sightless eyes. Not hearing. Not
               seeing. Just needing to do something with herself.



               INT. SHOES'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               A hand pops a tape into a VHS player.

               MUZI sits down in front of the TV. Presses play on the
               remote.



               VIDEO FOOTAGE:

               Muzi watches in wrapt attention.



               VIDEO FOOTAGE:

               Spikiri speaks to the OFF SCREEN CAMERAMAN.

                                   SPIKIRI
                         This move I'm about to show you is
                         called Sizwile.

                                   CAMERAMAN (O.C.)
                         Meaning?

                                   SPIKIRI
                         We heard you.

                                   CAMERAN (O.C.)
                         We heard you?

                                   SPIKIRI
                         Ja. Sizwile. We heard you. I've
                         never done it before in public.
                         It's top secret. My show Stopper.
                         Don't try this at home.

               CAMERA TRACKS BACK as

               Spikiri takes a step back and --

               THE FOOTAGE GOES BLURRY -- WHITE LINES CUT ACROSS THE SCREEN.

               ON MUZI.

               He rewinds the tape. Replays. 

               Same thing. Rewinds again. Replays. 

               No change.

               Muzi shakes his head, frustrated.



               INT. LERATO'S LOUNGE - NIGHT

               GOGO plomps down beside LERATO, takes the remote and turns
               off the TV.

               Lerato doesn't move.

                                   GOGO
                         Oh my child.

               Lerato is silent.

                                   GOGO (CONT'D)
                         I remember the first time you told
                         me about Vuyo. You came home one
                         day, smiling from ear to ear.
                         Walking as if you were floating
                         through the air. I knew you were in
                         love, even though you didn't want
                         to tell me.

               Lerato cracks a smile.

                                   GOGO (CONT'D)
                         I knew that that Vuyo was crazy. I
                         told you someone who people called
                         Spikiri was nothing but trouble. 

               Lerato's smile fades.

                                   GOGO (CONT'D)
                         But you said you were in love. It
                         was always Vuyo this and Vuyo that.
                             (beat)
                         I had to let you go, because I knew
                         that you had to be who you had to
                         be, not who I wanted you to be.

               She let's that hang there for a second, gets up.

                                   GOGO (CONT'D)
                         You need to let go of the past
                         Lerato. The boy isn't his father.

               She leaves. Lerato stares at the TV, digesting what she's
               just heard.



               EXT. FIELD OF DREAMS - DAY - (DREAM SEQUENCE)

               MUZI, seven years old, with Spikiri. Spikiri holding him
               aloft and Muzi screaming in fear. 

                                   MUZI
                         Put me down.

               Tears run down his face. Spikiri laughs.

                                   SPIKIRI
                         Don't be scared. I won't drop you.

                                   MUZI
                         No, put me down.

                                   SPIKIRI
                         Eish, okay. Sizwile.

               Muzi screams louder.

                                   SPIKIRI (CONT'D)
                         Sizwile.

               He puts him down.

               END DREAM SEQUENCE.



               INT. SHOES'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               MUZI's eyes pop open. 

               He's stretched out on the couch. The VHS tape lies next to
               him. 

               He hears a noise that jolts him bolt upright. It comes again.
               He waits for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.

               He hears it again. A CLICK. He sees the front door crack
               open.

                                   MUZI
                         Shoes?

               THREE ATTACKERS burst into the room and pounce on Muzi. He
               SHOUTS as 

               One Attacker grapples with him.

               Another Attacker grabs the VHS tape.

               SHOES leaps into the room, grabs the attacker with the tape. 

               Muzi and his attacker struggle. The third attacker approaches
               them, arm raised. In it, a gleaming knife.

                                   SHOES
                         Muzi! 

               SHOES charges at the attacker.

               CRASH. SHOES roars in anger.

                                   ATTACKER
                             (trembling voice)
                         Go! Go! Go!

               The Attackers bolt out of the room, overturning chairs and
               knocking over the table.

               Muzi is after them in an instant.

                                   SHOES
                         Muzi! 

               Something about Shoes's voice makes Muzi stop. He flips the
               light switch, bathing the room in orange light. 

               Shoes is breathing hard.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         It was Prince. 

               He holds up the VHS tape. The case is cracked open. A spool
               of tape falls to the ground.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         He wanted the tape.

               ON Muzi. Stunned. Shoes registers the shock on Muzi's face.
               Follows Muzi's gaze to his own chest. 

               A crimson stain. Spreading and darkening each second.

               Shoes stumbles back onto the chair. Muzi grabs him just as he
               falls. 

               He groans. Muzi looks at him, bewildered, not sure what to
               do.



               EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY (NEW DAY)

               The sun rises over an imposing hospital building. Think Chris
               Hani Baragwanath.



               INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

               SHOES lies in a hospital bed, asleep. A bandage wrapped
               around his left shoulder.

               Across from him, also asleep, is MUZI.

                                   LERATO
                         Oh my child.

               LERATO rushes Muzi. He's barely woken up when he finds
               himself wrapped in his mothers arms.

               GOGO brings up the rear, looking concerned. 

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         I came as soon as I heard.
                             (to Shoes)
                         How are you feeling?

               Shoes forces a smile.

                                   SHOES
                         Terrible.

               Lerato's eyes well up.

                                   LERATO
                         I'm so sorry.

                                   MUZI
                         No. I'm sorry. I said some really
                         stupid things..

                                   LERATO
                         You were right. I've tried to
                         protect you from the past for too
                         long. And that's not fair.

               She turns to Shoes.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         Shoes. For twelve years I wouldn't
                         speak to you because I blamed  you
                         for Vuyo's death. But I can't carry
                         that in my heart anymore. I can't.

               Shoes takes her hand. She hugs him. Muzi looks on,
               bewildered.

                                   MUZI
                         Is it true?

               Shoes looks away.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Was it your fault?

               The tension in the room is palpable. 

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Was it your fault my father died?

               Lerato and Shoes exchange a look.

                                   GOGO
                         Let's go and get Shoes some fruit,
                         Lerato.

               Lerato hangs back for a second, hesitant. She walks out.
               Shoes is silent for a beat. Muzi watches him, fear growing in
               his eyes. Shoes heaves a heavy sigh.

                                   SHOES
                         Yes. It was my fault.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET PARTY - EVENING - (FLASHBACK)

               A street party. Early naughties (as in 2000s) house music
               blasting from open car doors. People dancing.

               SPIKIRI walks through the crowd, a king amongst his subjects.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         Your father had just got back from
                         touring the States. It was the
                         first time the Americans saw
                         pantsula and they loved it. Boom
                         Shaka booked him for a tour as soon
                         as he landed.
                             (beat)
                         I so wanted to be as good as he
                         was. I would do anything.

               SHOES stands in a corner with a DEALER. Money changes hands,
               as well as a small white baggie. Shoes pockets it.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET PARTY - EVENING - (FLASHBACK)

               SHOES and SPIKIRI quarreling in the middle of the party.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         He hated what I was doing. He told
                         me that drugs would destroy me. I
                         was like a younger brother to him. 

               Spikiri, livid, spots the Dealer. He goes up to him and
               shoves him to the ground.

               And what follows happens so quickly that no one can stop it--

               Dealer grabs a beer bottle on the ground. Breaks it on the
               pavement. Leaps to his feet. Stabs Spikiri in the neck.

               Everyone is shocked. Spikiri grabs his neck.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         It was all my fault.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREET PARTY - EVENING - (FLASHBACK)

               SHOES cradles a lifeless SPIKIRI. The wail of sirens rises in
               the background. People scamper.

               Shoes looks up, helpless terror in his eyes.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         The cops were so close they
                         would've seen me throw the baggie
                         away.

               In one fateful split moment he decides. He grabs the baggie
               out his pocket, shoves it in Spikiri's pocket as--

               TWO POLICEMEN arrive at the scene.

                                   SHOES (V.O.)
                         It was the dumbest thing I ever did
                         in my life.

               END FLASHBACK.



               INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY - (PRESENT DAY)

               Tears stream down Muzi's face.

                                   SHOES
                         I was never able to dance again. I
                         couldn't. 
                             (beat)
                         I swore on your father's grave that
                         I'd spend the rest of my life
                         making up for what I did that day.

               Muzi stares at him, hatred in his eyes.

                                   MUZI
                         How could you?

                                   SHOES
                         I'm sorry.

               Muzi gets up, turns away.

                         Muzi. But when I saw you that day I
                         thought maybe. Maybe this time I
                         can pay Spikiri back by making you
                         the person you were meant to be.

                                   MUZI
                         You lied to me.

                                   SHOES
                         I told you what you needed to hear. 

               This is too much for Muzi. He sits down again.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Become who you're meant to be,
                         Muzi. It's the only way. 

               Muzi is silent, his mind racing.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         Your father took a knife because of
                         me.

               Muzi looks up.

                                   MUZI
                         And you did the same for me.

               Shoes nods.

                                   SHOES
                         Then I guess we're even now.

               Muzi stares long and hard at Shoes.

                                   SHOES (CONT'D)
                         You know what you have to do.
                         Prince is --

                                   MUZI
                             (interrupts)
                         --Prince is my brother.

                                   SHOES
                         That's why you have to save him.
                             (beat)
                         From himself.
                             (beat)
                         You're the only one who can do it.

               Muzi digests this.



               EXT. SANDTON - EVENING

               Wide boulevards. Shimmering skyscrapers. High end cars. The
               evening streets of Sandton smack of opulence.



               INT. NIGHTCLUB - EVENING

               At a table in a nightclub, the THREE CELEBRITY JUDGES (we
               last saw them at the Hear Me Move Joburg Qualifiers) are
               seated at a table having drinks and laughing.

               The laughter subsides as--

               PRINCE walks up to them. He drops three envelopes on the
               table.

               CELEBRITY JUDGE ONE picks up the envelope and opens it. It's
               stuffed full of money.

                                   PRINCE
                         Ambishn's going to win the
                         competition on Saturday.

               The Celebrity Judges trade looks. Celebrity Judge One smiles,
               pockets the envelope. 

                                   CELEBRITY JUDGE ONE
                         You know the crowd will vote how
                         they want, right?

                                   PRINCE
                         Leave the crowd to me.

               He looks at the other two celebrity judges. They pick up the
               envelopes and pocket them, smiling. Deal is sealed.

                                   CELEBRITY JUDGE ONE
                         Yo man. Grab a drink.

               Prince leaves him hanging and just walks away.



               EXT. TOWNSHIP STREETS - EVENING

               The township streets are quiet.



               INT. MUZI'S BEDROOM - EVENING

               MUZI sits on his bed. In his hands a photo of Spikiri with
               Shoes.

               He stares at the photo, doesn't notice LERATO appear at the
               door.

               Lerato takes in the moment, not wanting to disturb it.

               Muzi flips the photo over. On the back, one word:

               "Sizwile". He looks at it with interest as if seeing it for
               the first time, though he's seen it many times before.

               Lerato turns to leave. Muzi hears her.

                                   MUZI
                         Wait.

               She does.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         What's this?

               He points to the text on the back of the photo.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Sizwile. 

                                   LERATO
                         Oh, that's you.

               Muzi looks up, surprised.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         Your father wrote that.

               She smiles. Sits beside him, and looks at the photo.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         He'd call you Sizwile when you were
                         a baby. You were always crying all
                         the time. He said you just wanted
                         to be heard. So he'd pick you up
                         and say, Ja, Sizwile. We've heard
                         you.

               She presses his hand. Gets up and leaves.

               Muzi gazes at the picture. A memory stirs in his mind.

                                   SPIKIRI (V.O.)
                         Ja. Sizwile. We heard you. I've
                         never done it before in public.
                         It's top secret. My show Stopper.
                         Don't try this at home.

               He looks at the reverse of the photo. Looks at the word
               written there: "SIZWILE". His face lights up in realization.

                                   MUZI
                             (to himself)
                         Sizwile.
                             (beat)
                         I am Sizwile.



               EXT. JOBURG CBD - DAY (NEW DAY)

               It's early morning in the city.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               MUZI sits, staring at the old photo of himself and his
               father.

               He looks up as hears--

               ORA, ZEE and the other crew members walking in. 

               KHANYI brings up the rear.

               They all stop when they see him. 

               Muzi stands up.

                                   ORA
                         Shoes said he'd meet us here.

                                   MUZI
                         He's still in hospital.

                                   KHANYI
                         So now he's lying to us? This is
                         nonsense. I'ma be late for class.
                         Let's go.

                                   MUZI
                         Guys, wait.

               They do so.

               Muzi clears his throat, takes one last look at the photo,
               drawing courage from it.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         I owe all you guys an apology. I've
                         let the crew down, and I've let
                         myself down.

               Khanyi folds her hands - defensive.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         But we can't quit now. Not when
                         we've come this far. 

                                   ORA
                         We don't have any more moves.
                         Prince and Shoes came up with
                         everything we did.

               The others nod in agreement.

                                   MUZI
                         That's not completely true.

               He walks across to the music system and turns it on. House
               beats blast through the space.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Prince destroyed Spikiri's tape but
                         I learnt the moves. 

               His gaze sweeps the room.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         So if you guys are willing to give
                         it a try, for Shoes, then so am I.

                                   KHANYI
                         You? Boss?

               Muzi nods.

                                   MUZI
                         Ja. 

               Zee smiles.

                                   ZEE
                         This I've got to see.

               He stands beside Muzi. Ready. The other dancers join him. 

               Only Khanyi and Ora are left watching. Muzi looks at Khanyi,
               pleading with his eyes.

                                   KHANYI
                         For Shoes.

               She joins them. Muzi smiles.

               Ora stands alone, by the door. Weighs his decision. Everyone
               watches him. He takes a step forward. 

                                   ORA
                         Okay.

                                   MUZI
                         We're going to beat Ambishn on
                         their own turf. We're taking this
                         to the streets.

                                                                CUT TO:

               EXT. JOBURG CBD - DAY

               A hand pulls back to reveal--

               AN ONLOOKER watching SBUJWA NATION dancing in the street,
               surrounded by a crowd of curious passers-by.

          END SERIES OF SHOTS.



               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               SBUJWA NATION complete the dance sequence with a flourish,
               laughing, cheering, clapping, whistling.

               THAMI enters, holding up his phone.

                                   THAMI
                         You guys are in big trouble.

               The others stop, look at him with questioning eyes.

                                   THAMI (CONT'D)
                         The competition's tomorrow and you
                         guys are trending. You've got more
                         followers than Prince and them.

               KHANYI squeals in excitement and gives Muzi a hug despite
               herself. They separate, embarrassed.

                                   ORA
                         Ja, guys. Save it for the
                         competition.

               Khanyi smiles coyly.



               EXT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - NIGHT

               A CROWD OF YOUNG PEOPLE mills about the entrance. A banner
               announces the event we've all been waiting for: "HEAR ME MOVE
               FINALS."



               INT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - NIGHT

               It's even more crowded inside. Banners everywhere.  A CROWD
               OF SPECTATORS squeezes around a dance floor, in the middle of
               which stands THE MC, mic in hand.

                         Reptiles.

               REPTILES execute a couple of b-boying moves. The crowd oohs
               and aahs.

                                   MC (CONT'D)
                         And finally. Qualifying in our last
                         qualification round in Pretoria and

                             (beat)
                         AMBISHN.

               PRINCE, PINKY, T-BOZ, ARNOLD and the OTHER AMBISHN DANCERS
               hype up the crowd. And the crowd gives a massive response.
               It's obvious who the crowd favorites are.

                                   MC (CONT'D)
                         Seven of these crews will walk out
                         of here today with mad respect. But
                         only one of them--
                             (beat)
                         Will tour the US with world renown
                         artistes and a cool two hundred and
                         fifty thousand rand in their
                         pockets.

               Rapturous applause from the crowd. The dancers glance around,
               nervous. Prince smirks.

                                   MC (CONT'D)
                         And you will be the judges. You'all
                         got your cards right.

               Affirmative yells from the crowd. Red and green cards dot the
               air.

                                   MC (CONT'D)
                         Then let's Hear Them Mooooooove!

                         Vaya Volcano!

               The MEMBERS OF Vaya Volcano step onto stage and stand in a
               row. The music begins. They pitch into a fast paced sbujwa
               and jerking hybrid sequence.

                                                                CUT TO:

                         So you came.

                                   ZEE
                         No. We didn't. You're just seeing
                         things.

                         Listen, we don't want to start any
                         trouble.

               Prince shoves Muzi.

                                   PRINCE
                         Too late for that.

               He glares at Ora.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         I see you forgave your rat.

                                   ORA
                             (falsely indignant)
                         Who you calling a rat?

                                   PRINCE
                         You didn't sound so cocky when you
                         tried to join our crew. When you
                         told us about Muzi and the tape.

               Shocked looks from Muzi, Khanyi, Zee and the other Sbujwa
               Nation members.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         See you on the dance floor.

               He and the A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members walks off. 

               Muzi, Zee and Khanyi turn to Ora.

                                   KHANYI
                         Is it true?

               Ora hangs his head.

                                   ZEE
                         Is it too late to kick him out?

               Everyone turns to Muzi. The decision rests with him.

                                                                CUT TO:

               SBUJWA NATION.

               Muzi looks long and hard at Ora. He reaches a decision, turns
               to the others.

                                   MUZI
                         We're a team. What's done is done.
                         If Ora didn't still want to be a
                         part of us, he wouldn't be here
                         now.

               He stretches out his hand. Ora looks at it.

                                   MC

               Khanyi shakes Ora's hand. Zee, begrudgingly, follows suit.

               ON MUZI.

               Oblivious. He is watching--



               LERATO. 

               Pushing her way to the front. 

               She came.



               ON MUZI.

               He pushes his way to the sidelines and embraces her in a
               tight hug.

                                   MUZI
                         You came!

                                   LERATO
                         I've seen those moves before
                         somewhere.

               Muzi can't help but smile.

                                   LERATO (CONT'D)
                         Go out there and do what you have
                         to do.

                         Let the final battle begin.

               The music is cued up.



               A.M.B.I.$.H.N. 

               Prince and his crew step up onto the stage.

               Their sequence is expertly choreographed. Machine-like.
               Precise. 

               They complete their sequence and --.



               ON THE CROWD.

               The CROWD OF SPECTATORS goes crazy. 



               ON THE MC.

               The MC has a hard time containing the crowd.

                                   MC
                         It's not over yet. It's not over.
                         Sbujwa Nation. Ambishn have brought
                         it to you. Show them what you've
                         got.



               ON SBUJWA NATION.

               SBUJWA NATION step into their opening positions - heads
               bowed. Muzi nods. The music begins.

               They start. They're damn good: synchronized, energetic,
               focused. They give it their all and produce a world class
               performance. 

               The music stops. They pause in their closing positions -
               heads bowed - same way they started. Looking stylish.

               The crowd blows up. 

               Muzi, Khanyi and the others smile. They know they've done
               well.

               The MC walks onto the stage.

                                   MC
                         You know the drill by now. Red
                         cards Ambishn. Green cards Sbujwa
                         Nation.
                             (beat)
                         Ambishn?



               ON THE CROWD.

               Half the crowd holds up Red Cards. 



               ON THE MC.

                                   MC
                         This is going to be tight... Sbujwa
                         Nation?



               ON THE CROWD.

               The other half hoist their Green cards and wave them.



               ON THE MC.

                                   MC
                         Judges. We have a tie. It's up to
                         you.



               ON THE CELEBRITY JUDGES. 

               They exchange a look. 



               ON PRINCE.

               He smiles smugly.



               ON THE CELEBRITY JUDGES.

                         The Judges adlib their thoughts
                         about the Ambishn performance
                         versus the Sbujwa Nation
                         performance...nothing definitive
                         though...

               The Judges hold up red cards. 



               ON A.M.B.I.$.H.N. 

               Their members erupt in racous celebration.

                                   MC
                         It's Ambishn. Ambishn take it.

               ON SBUJWA NATION.

               Downcast. They exchange forlorn looks. 

                                   KHANYI
                         We tried.

                                   ZEE
                         Ja, at least we came second.

               Muzi stares at the judges. Sees them exchange a look with
               Prince.

                                   MUZI
                             (aloud, to himself)
                         No!

               He steps onto the stage, pushing his way through celebrating
               A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members.

               He grabs the mic from the MC.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                             (shouting into mic)
                         HEY!!!

               The cheering dies down - all eyes are on Muzi. 

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Majitas...this doesn't make sense.
                         I say we have one last round. A tie
                         breaker.

                                   PRINCE
                             (shouting)
                         You've lost! Voetsek...

               Muzi ignores him.

                                   MUZI
                             (into mic)
                         One last round to decide. What do
                         you say?

               The MC takes the mic from him.

                                   MC
                             (into mic)
                         The competition rules state that
                         the judge's decision is final.

                                   CELEBRITY JUDGES
                         The Celebrity judges give reasons
                         why their say is final and why Muzi
                         must shut up and go home.

               Muzi takes back the mic, addresses the crowd.

                                   MUZI
                         Green cards for yes. Red cards for
                         No.

               ON PRINCE. Livid.

               He steps up to Muzi. Muzi steps away from him.



               ON THE CROWD.

               A flurry of green cards cover the arena. 



               ON MUZI.

               Muzi smiles, satisfied. Prince grabs the mic from him.

                                   PRINCE
                             (into mic)
                         Bafwethu. This guy is jealous. He
                         got me kicked out of my crew, and
                         now I've won with another crew he
                         wants to do it again. This isn't
                         fair.

                                   MUZI
                         The crowd has decided Prince. It's
                         not over.

               Prince looks at the green cards dotting the space. Looks at
               the Judges. They look defeated. He weighs his options for a
               second, face narrows.

                                   PRINCE
                             (into mic)
                         Okay. But this is between you and
                         me. Solo.

               The A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members nod their agreement. SBUJWA NATION
               looks on.

                                   CELEBRITY JUDGES
                         The Celebrity Judges give reasons
                         to Prince about why he shouldn't go
                         ahead with it.

               Muzi considers this for a second. He grabs the mic from
               Prince.

                                   MUZI
                             (into mic)
                         I don't dance without my crew.

               ON Khanyi. Breaking into a smile.

                                   PRINCE
                         Fine!

               He thinks quickly.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Five minutes. 

                                   MUZI
                         Five minutes.

               Prince storms off. The MC takes the mic back.

                                   MC
                         The drama never stops. In five
                         minutes we will have the showdown
                         of the century.

               The crowd breaks into rapturous applause. Prince storms off. 



               ON SBUJWA NATION.

               Muzi rejoins them. 

                                   ZEE
                         Sho mfethu!

                                   ORA
                         Grand grand you've got balls.

                                   MUZI
                         That guy's cheated. He did
                         something to the judges. 

                                   KHANYI
                         Look at them now.

               ON A.M.B.I.$.H.N.

               Prince having a hushed discussion with his teammates. They
               all head out towards the bathrooms.

               ON MUZI.

                                   MUZI
                         Dammnit. They're going to take a
                         hit.

               He heads off after them.

                                   KHANYI
                         Where are you going?

               Muzi doesn't turn back.

                                   MUZI
                         We've come too far for this Khanyi.
                         I'm going to stop them.

               Ora and Zee stand looking at each other blankly.

                                   KHANYI
                         Go after him damnit!

               They snap into action, just in time to see Muzi push his way
               through the crowds towards the bathroom. 

               They follow him.



               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               PRINCE, T-BOZ and ARNOLD pass a baggie round, using their
               fingernails to scoop up and sniff the white powder.

               The door bursts open and Muzi enters, phone held aloft in his
               hand.

                                   MUZI
                         I've got you guys on video. It's
                         over Prince.

               The A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members hem him in.

                                   PRINCE
                         Someone take that phone from him.

               Arnold grabs the phone.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         You think you're better, neh. You
                         and your stupid little speeches. 

                                   MUZI
                         At least I don't need drugs to
                         dance.

                                   PRINCE
                         Maybe I learnt from your father.

               He and the other A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members burst out laughing.

               Muzi roars in anger and hurls himself at Prince, tackling him
               to the ground. 

               Prince's hand. The flick of a switchblade. A glint of light
               on a flash of steel.

               Muzi screams in pain just as--

               ORA and ZEE storm into the bathroom.

               Prince struggles to his feet, breathing hard, pocketing the
               blade.

               The other A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members look on in shock.

                                   PRINCE (CONT'D)
                         Let's go!

               He bolts out, his cronies hot on his heels.

               Muzi's leaps his feet. He groans and doubles over, clutching
               his side. Ora helps him up.

                                   ZEE
                         Are you sharp?

               Muzi winces. A rapidly spreading blood stain on his side.

                                   ORA
                         Yo, yo, yo!

                                   MUZI
                         I'm alright. 

                                   ORA
                         We have to take you to hospital.

                                   ZEE
                         There's an ambulance outside.

                                   MUZI
                         No. We're on next.

                                   ORA
                         Are you crazy?

                                   ZEE
                         You can't dance like that!

               Muzi looks at his bloodied t-shirt. Zee's right. A RANDOM KID
               walks in.

                                   MUZI
                         Give me your t-shirt.

               The Random Kid looks at Muzi, surprised. 

                                   RANDOM KID
                         What?

               He sees Muzi's wound. 

                                   RANDOM KID (CONT'D)
                         No way!

                                   MUZI
                             (threatening)
                         Give me your t-shirt.

               RANDOM KID pulls off his t-shirt, scared stiff, remains in
               his vest. Muzi takes his own t-shirt off, ties it around his
               side and puts the Random Kid's t-shirt on top.

               Ora and Zee look at him as if he's crazy.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Let's go.

               He starts to walk out. Ora blocks his way.

                                   ORA
                         Listen man. You can't do this.

               Muzi's eyes burn into him.

                                   MUZI
                         I'm going to beat him, Ora. I have
                         to.

               Ora steps aside.

               Muzi walks out the bathroom.



               INT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - NIGHT

               MUZI weaves his way through the crowd, wincing in pain,
               flanked by ORA and ZEE.

                                   MC

                         ready?

               A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Steps onto the stage. 

               SBUJWA NATION step up on the opposite side. 

               Khanyi takes one look at Muzi, sees he's in pain.

                                   KHANYI
                         What the hell happened?

                                   ORA
                         Prince stabbed --

                         Shut up.

               Khanyi gawks. She sees traces of blood on Muzi's side.

                         This is crazy. You can't--

                                   MUZI
                         I'm not letting you guys down.
                         We're going to finish this.

               Khanyi folds her hands.

                         I'm not dancing.

               Muzi levels her with a stare.

                                   MC
                         Let's go.

               MUSIC starts up.

               A.M.B.I.$.H.N. takes the stage and --

               Like a dam that is broken they burst out into a frenzy of
               pure sbujwa energy. 

               Their faces contorted, every nerve of their bodies strained.
               And then--

               PRINCE BREAKS OUT INTO A SOLO.

               His energy is superhuman. 

               He completes the move with a huge leap and lands on his knees
               and slides up to Muzi, daunting him. Challenging him--

               And Muzi leaps over Prince, doing a cartwheel and ushering

               SBUJWA NATION ONTO THE STAGE.

               Their performance is exhilarating. The excellence of
               execution. They smile. They enjoy it. They play with it.

               Muzi at the front, leading. The blood stain on his side
               widening. And the crowd is eating out of their hands when--

               MUZI BREAKS INTO A SOLO.



               INT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - NIGHT

               MUZI moves to the edge of circle, motions his crew to clear
               the space.

               The Audience is ecstatic. They can feel something big's
               coming.

               The blood stain on Muzi's side's getting larger. 

               He closes his eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

                         Yeah. I've never done it before in
                         public. It's top secret. My show

               Muzi's eyes are closed. The bloodstain on his side gets
               larger.

                                                                CUT TO:

               Muzi opens his eyes. Muzi crosses to one side of the stage,
               prepared to do a run up.

                                   MUZI
                             (to himself)
                         I can do this.

               He takes a step forward. The blood stain on his side even
               larger. He takes a step forward, stumbles, regains his
               footing. 



               ON THE CROWD.

               The audience gasps. 



               BACK ON THE STAGE.

                                   MC
                         Stop the music.

                                   MUZI
                         No.

               Muzi takes a step, swoons and stumbles, dropping to one knee.

               Prince smiles. The audience falls silent.

               Muzi grasps his side, and looks at the blood on his hand. It
               seems like someone else's, and he--

               FALLS TO THE GROUND.

               Stunned silence everywhere. Everyone is frozen. The music
               stops.

               Khanyi rushes over to Muzi, cradling him in her hands. 

                                   KHANYI
                         Muzi...Muzi...

               ON LERATO. Pushing her way through the crowd.

               Muzi's eyes flutter and close.

               Her voice recedes further and further away.

                                                                CUT TO:



               EXT. FIELD OF DREAMS - DAY - (DREAM SEQUENCE)

               SPIKIRI puts the seven year old MUZI down, seats him on the
               grass. The little boy stares up into Spikiri's face. Spikiri
               moves across the frame, obscuring the young face for an
               instant, and moves off frame to reveal--

               The present day fully grown MUZI, on the ground, where the
               boy had been. He stares up into Spikiri's face.

                                   MUZI
                         Pa. 

                                   SPIKIRI
                         Sizwile is inside of you. It's
                         inside your heart. That's what
                         makes it special.

               Spikiri stretches out his hand. Muzi raises his. 

               Both hands grasp each other tight.

               END DREAM SEQUENCE.



               INT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - NIGHT

               MUZI gets up as if yanked upwards by some unseen hand.

               Everyone steps back, surprised.

               Muzi glares at the DJ. Gives him a solemn nod.

               The DJ starts the music.

                                   KHANYI 
                         No.

               Muzi doesn't hear her. He moves to the edge of the circle and
               does a run up.

               He leaps into the air and cartwheels once, twice, three times
               and --

               Lands on his head then--

               Spins, B-boy style, then --

               Leaps to his feet. And stands there, panting.

               The crowd is absolutely silent.

               Muzi closes his eyes, hangs his head, exhausted.

               The ground shakes as ear shattering applause erupts from
               every corner. 

               Green cards cover the arena.

                                   MC
                         Judges?

               The crowd starts chanting "Green...Green...Green..." 

                                   CELEBRITY JUDGES
                         The Celebrity judges adlib their
                         reasons for voting for Prince and
                         why Muzi sucked.

               CELEBRITY JUDGE ONE hesitates then holds up a red card. JUDGE
               TWO looks at Judge One and does the same. Three follows suit.

               Resounding "Boos" from the crowd. A bottle hurls through the
               air and connects with CELEBRITY JUDGE ONE. More follow. A
               riot is afoot.

               The Judges lift green cards, ducking to avoid the missiles
               flying through the air.

                                   CELEBRITY JUDGES (CONT'D)
                         The Celebrity Judges call for
                         security and say that this it
                         totally unacceptable. They've been
                         forced by the crowd - this is not
                         democractic.

                                   MC
                         The Judges have spoken. It's Sbujwa

               The crowd breaks into ecstatic cheers. 

               Muzi falls, limp. Ora and Zee catch him. 

                                   KHANYI
                         You did it.

               Muzi smiles weakly.

                                   MUZI
                         No. We did it.

               The PARAMEDICS arrive with a stretcher.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         Wait.

               He hobbles over to Prince. Prince looks at him with a mixture
               of alarm and anger.

               The whole crowd goes silent, all eyes on these two rivals
               standing face to face.

               And Muzi hugs Prince. Holds him tight.

                                   MUZI (CONT'D)
                         I'm not leaving here without you
                         brother.

               And Prince starts sobbing. Muzi goes limp and Prince grabs
               him, holding him up. The PARAMEDICS run up.

                                   PRINCE
                         Don't touch him. Move back.

               And he takes Muzi up in his arms and carries him out of the
               arena, tears streaming down his face.

               Arnold takes up the chant: "Muzi. Muzi. Muzi."

               The other A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members follow suit.

               "Muzi. Muzi. Muzi."

               In a second, it spreads like wildfire. The entire audience is
               chanting "Muzi. Muzi. Muzi."

               The sound fills the entire space.

               "Muzi. Muzi. Muzi."



               EXT. JOBURG COMPETITION VENUE - NIGHT

               PRINCE lifts MUZI into the waiting ambulance. Muzi hears the
               chanting.

                                   MUZI
                         Is that?

                                   PRINCE
                         They're saying your name.

               Muzi smiles.

                         Is he going to be alright?

                                   PARAMEDIC
                         Yes ma'am. It's nothing serious.

                                   LERATO
                         Thank God.

               She takes Muzi's hand.

                         I'm really proud of you son.

               Muzi smiles. The PARAMEDICS start to close the ambulance
               doors. Khanyi comes running up.

                                   KHANYI
                         Wait!

               They pause. She rushes to Muzi's side and gives him a long
               kiss.

               Muzi is surprised, then enjoys the moment. When she pulls
               away --

               He smiles. Looking deep into her eyes. 

               The ambulance doors obstruct his views. Her stunning eyes the
               last thing he sees as we--

               PRINCE, and the other A.M.B.I.$.H.N. Members.

               SHOES, MUZI and LERATO walk in.

                                   KHANYI
                         Muzi!

               She runs up to him and gives him a tight hug.

                                   MUZI
                         Ouch! Easy there.

               She rushes over to the corner.

                                   SHOES
                         Hey. This crew's grown a lot since
                         I left.

               Khanyi returns bearing a cake, grinning from ear to ear.

                                   MUZI
                         Wow!

                                   KHANYI
                         It's home made.

                                   MUZI
                         What? You're baking now?

                                   KHANYI
                         Er. No. My mum made it. I told her
                         about you and she thought it would
                         be nice.

                                   MUZI
                         You moved back in with them?

               She nods and smiles.

                                   KHANYI
                         You've shown me the meaning of
                         family.

               She gives him a kiss. Lerato clears her throat.

                                   SHOES
                         You guys ready for the States?

                                   PRINCE
                         We'll show them the meaning of
                         sbujwa.

               And they launch into a SBUJWA DANCE SEQUENCE, leaping into
               the air with a flourish as we--

               FREEZE THE IMAGE and--

                                                              FADE OUT.

          END CREDITS.
