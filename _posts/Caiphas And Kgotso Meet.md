Caiphas and Kgotso both ordered the steak and french fries from the menus that the waiter collected from them. They were seated inside a restaurant in a busy shopping mall.
"So, how are we going to make it work again?" Caiphas asked, as the waiter wandered off to get them their orders.
"It's simple, bra," Kgotso said, taking a sip of his drink. "You've already sent in your CV, right?"
"Right."
"That's even better. I'm heading up the team that has to sift through them. We are meant to come up with a shortlist of five names by the end of the week. I'll say that we could only find three people that were qualified enough to put on that shortlist, and then I will strongly motivate for you to get the position."
"And you're sure it will work?"
"Trust me, I do this all the time bro. It works like a charm. Quite frankly, I'm surprised you never approached me sooner. I'm all about helping people man. We've got to stick together. It's hard out here if your all alone."
"Yeah, I guess your right." Caiphas said. He pulled a brown envelope out of his jacket pocket and putting it in front of Kgotso. Kgotso took it and put it in his own jacket pocket without even batting an eyelid.
"Aren't you going to count it?" Caiphas asked.
"I trust you, bro," Kgotso replied, cracking a smile. "I know it's all there." Caiphas did not feel the relieved in the slightest bit by that answer, and took a sip of his drink nervously.  The waiter arrived with their orders, placing two plates of steaming hot steaks and fries in front of the two of them.
"That was quick!" Kgotso excalimed, smiling. "Bon appetit!"
"Yeah, sure," Caiphas replied, as he pulled his fork and knife out from the serviette wrapped around them.
