My yoke is easy and my burden is light.

  

I was just speaking to a young man now. A good man. Well brought up in the faith, and he described to me the struggles he has had with #Chastity and the falls - big falls - with the his fiancée and his concerns around how it would affect his marriage . I told him he will have to do penance, and part of the penance will the the oroblems the falls in Chastity created

  

I came away with two convictions:

1.  My #vocation is not a small deal. God wants to use me to spread light to other people. I often do not see this because it’s better that I only see it quite rarely and faintly , because pride is what causes the corruption of this #light God shines through the poor lantern I am
2.  #Celibacy is a burden. But the inchastity that enslaves so many people is a far greater burden. Hence the gift of celibacy is a yoke that is easy and a burden that is light . I need to tell this to many young people.
