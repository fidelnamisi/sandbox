1. BEAK, FEATHER AND BONE
   
   Beak, Feather and Bone is a map-making TTRPG. It works quite well with two players, though I've never tried it with more than two. 

2. MICROSCOPE

	This is a great tool for making timelines. It's not easy to write a story without a clear understanding of the timeline of the story world.
   
3. WONDERDRAFT
	A very cool app for making maps. Start by making a map in Wonderdraft, and then take it through to Beak, Feather and Bone to flesh it out.


**Test 1 ...Without %**
Running with the [2022-07-18-The-Iceberg-Theory-of-Worldbuilding](_posts/2022-07-18-The-Iceberg-Theory-of-Worldbuilding.md), then the story is the part that's visible above the water, and the storyworld is the two-thirds that is submerged.

**The Tools I've Tried For Building The Visible Part (Plot)**

1. Tapestry - Another RPG for collaboratively making plots. Doesn't seem to work that well.
2. Various other tools.

The stories seem to come organically once I spend enough time immersed in the world. I'm not too sure that plotting tools or games are even needed. They don't seem to be of great help, overwhelmingly.
