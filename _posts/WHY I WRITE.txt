No story I write will ever change the world. But every story I write will always change me. 

Every story I write is a quest for the truth - the truth about a character, a feeling, a flaw, or a situation - the truth about others and ultimately, the truth about myself.

The process of crafting a beautiful narrative and executing on it in the real world meets my need for truth, wisdom, creativity and being autonomous while making a difference in my life first and foremost. Maybe even allowing God to make me holier. 

I don't add value. I create value. For myself first and foremost and if I'm exceedingly lucky,  maybe even for someone else.
