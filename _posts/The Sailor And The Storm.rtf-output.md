THE SAILOR AND THE STORM

A lone sailor found himself caught in a terrible storm. He called out to his gods for help. After several more days of storm tossed seas, violent winds and strong winds, he scolded his gods for having ignored his prayer. And out of the winds, he heard a voice say 
"But you are still alive, and have mastered how to navigate your boat through a stormy sea. What better help could I have given you than making you a master of the
seas?"
