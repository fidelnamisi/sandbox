title: No Match For It Is To Be Found
tags: review poem
---


>This poem was inspired by Liv Taylor's portrayal of Arwen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson.

No match for it is to be found,
<br>
No flaw in it, tis fully sound.
<br>
<br>
It thaws the coldest hearts to dew,
<br>
Brilliant brightness, shining through,
<br>
<br>
Like summer rain, the locks unfold,
<br>
Oer eyes bewitching to behold,
<br>
<br>
That crown the ruby red-rose lips,
<br>
Whose smile would draw Achilles's ships.
<br>
<br>
There is no man who as yet lives,
<br>
That can bestow as nature gives.
<br>
<br>
Though none merits such great treasure,
<br>
She was blessd in such great measure.
<br>
<br>
In all creation's beauty,
<br>
Her's best reflects Deity.
<br>
<br>
Oh pity us, such poor men,  
<br>
Who see the Lady Arwen.
