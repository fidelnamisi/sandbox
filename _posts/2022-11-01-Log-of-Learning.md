<!---Tuesday 01 November 2022--->

When working, make the mental effort to break the task into the smallest chunks possible. This does two things:
1. It makes it easy to set an attainable target for a single work session, whether it be a 25 minuter or a 50 minuter.
2. It makes it really easy to communicate the task to my workmate on FocusMate, and to keep typing regular updates when I am done with microtasks. That enhances focus and maintains a sense of momentum.
