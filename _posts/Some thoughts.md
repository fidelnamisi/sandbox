# Who Am I

  

  

Being #myself is one of the best acts of worship of God. It is telling him that he did a good job creating me as I real-ly am, not as I imagine myself to be. Lord, help me to see myself as I really am. As you really made me.

  

I am worth nothing. This I know to be true.

  

I know nothing. I used to think I know stuff, then I realized that after 20 years in Opus Dei, I still don't know what love is, what offering up is, what fraternity is... I know nothing. This I know to be true.

  

I still think that I can do something. God will debunk this myth in due course, I am sure.

  

I have #nothing. This too, God will debunk.
