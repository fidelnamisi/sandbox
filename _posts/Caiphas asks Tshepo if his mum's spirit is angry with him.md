Caiphas drove slowly through the winding street of the golf estate where Tshepo lived with Lerato and her son. There were several traffic circles, each with a statue of a little angel spitting a jet of silver water out of its mouth. In between the massive houses of various designs, ranging from classical to modern, he caught glimpses of the bright green golf course that the houses bordered. He pulled up in front of the familiar entrance to Number 43, The Gables.  The house was Bauhaus in its design, and Tshepo had wanted it built with as many windows as possible. From the outside, one could pretty much see quite a bit of the house.  Tshepo stood outside the door, waiting for Caiphas. He was dressed in a tracksuit and had a towel hanging around his neck. Beads of sweat trickled down his forehead. 
"Morning," Caiphas said, stepping out of his car. "No gym today?" Caiphas asked as he walked up the stairs that led up to the door.
"No," Tshepo replied, panting. "Went for a jog rather."
"How was it?"
"Age's catching up, hey. Let's take a walk around the garden. I need to warm down." Tshepo led the way  across the white paving slabs that led to the golf course behind the house. Caiphas was relieved that they were going to walk.
The sun was out, it was warm, and Caiphas didn't want to have the conversation he was planning to have whilst being cooped up indoors, just in case things got ugly and he needed to make a speedy get-away. 

Seven o'clock on a Saturday morning seemed to be a popular golfing hour with the residents of the estate. Already, there were several small groups that were snaking their way along the golf course, lugging their white golf bags behind them. 
"I guess you wanted to speak about the CEO thing, hey?" his father asked, looking off into the distance at a group that was just about to tee off.
"Yes and no." Tshepo shot him a questioning glance.
"I guess I wanted to find out what your plan is for me."
"How do you mean?"
"The thing is, I've been working my fingers to the bone for you, and I was really expected to get this position."
"But surely you can understand that the board would want someone a little older and more experienced at the helm of the company."
"But it's your company! You can run it the way you want."
"I wish that were the case. I really do. But maybe it's for the best, son. I mean," he placed his hand gently on Caiphas's shoulder, "I think you would also appreciate being respected for what you've achieved. How would you feel if every time you walk through the doors of the office, everyone is looking at you thinking that the only reason you're boss is because you're my son?"
Caiphas was quiet for moment. Though he hated to admit it, his father raised a valid point. The last thing that Caiphas wanted was people thinking that he was his old man's lackey.  "Besides," his father added, "It's not a family business. I wish it were, but it isn't. And I'm under a lot of pressure already because of having involved you and Lerato in it. Some people are calling it nepotism."
"That's nonsense."
"It is nonsense. But there's nothing much we can do about it."
Caiphas shook his head. He was struggling with something. Tshepo could see it, and wanted to say something, but decided against it.
"I don't know," Caiphas said eventually. "Everything was going so well one year ago, and then all of a sudden ---," he groaned. "I'm just a failure."
"You're twenty eight, man. How can you be putting so much pressure on yourself.  You just need a little bit of perspective, that all. Look at what you achieved with K.C.I. Look at what your achieving with Chuene Civils. Look at the restaurant. How did that go?"
"Yes. We got the restaurant."
"And how hard was it?"
"Not too hard," Caiphas replied, smiling. "All it took was a couple of meetings."
"You see?", Tshepo said, wrapping a hand around Caiphas's shoulder and dragging him towards himself. "That's the problem with you kids nowadays. You've got no patience. You want everything now, now, now."  He patted Caiphas on the back. Caiphas forced a smile.
"I guess you're right."
"Of course I'm right. Just be patient and give things the time and the space that they need. Everything will happen when the time's right."
"I guess it's just harder when I think of where I was last year."
"So what? You've learnt a lot. Let it go and move on."
"That's exactly what Lerato said," Caiphas replied, smiling. "You two ---same whatsapp group."
"Like father like daughter," Tshepo said, laughing. Caiphas frowned. Tshepo had just brought something else to his mind. Something that he had been battling not to think about and to sweep under the rug. But it had just kept on coming back. He thought he might as well get it off his chest.
"Something else's been bugging me."
"Yeah?"
"Mum."
"What about her?"
"Lerato seems to think that she may be angry with me. That's why things just went south."
"Lerato said that?"
"Yeah," Caiphas lied. "And I think she's right. I mean...I only saw her grave at the funeral. We never did an unveiling. Never did a ten year anniversary. And this year, the twentieth anniversary just came and went and nothing happened --- I don't know. Maybe she's angry."
"That's nonsense! How can your mother be angry at you?"
"I dunno...I was just thinking."
"Your mother loved you more than life itself. There's no way she's going to be mad at you and is trying to get even or something. Get even how? What's she got to gain. Besides," he added, carefully picking his words, "Sometimes I even doubt all this stuff about, you know... the ancestors."
Caiphas nodded slowly. "I guess you're right."
"Come on," Tshepo patted him on the back. "I'm starving. Let's go and have some breakfast. Have you eaten?"
"No, not yet." Caiphas said, and followed his father as Tshepo turned back up the path towards the house.
