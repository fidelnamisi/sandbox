ON #FAILURES, #DISAPPOINTMENTS, #DISCOURAGEMENT AND UNANSWERED PRAYER AND MORTIFICATION

  
Sometimes I pray and then I ask God for things like my work to go well and for me to get money...and then I don't...

  

Then this makes me lose faith in God ... And from now on, I want to remember this...that everything I have is from God...and when I pray for work or money and God doesn't grant it IN THE WAY that I want, I will remember that, rather than despairing and thinking I am out here on my own (God has no reason to abandon me at all)... I will remember that God is saying, "I want to provide for you in another, better way..."

  

This thing is like a cancer in my soul that weakens my faith and leads to small betrayals against Our Lord and self-seeking. I pray and mortifying and take action for people to whistle or to get steady work...and nothing happens. Then, Lord, the enemy plants the seed of doubt, telling me that I am on my own...that You are not with me...that I am alone and out here grinding on my own. Lord, fruitlessness in the apostolate really does cause me a lot of pain and grief. And I know it could be simply self seeking and wrong intentions...but it's also that sometimes I just need a sign that I am on the right path...that's all. But it could be that God is protecting me from pride...and the discouragement stems from pride...and could lead to either pride or to humility.

  

  

Every time I think of the massive massive effort it takes to actually produce a book or proposal and then nothing comes of it, the antidote to keep in mind is to pray for more faith...and to remember that for those who love God, everything works out for the good...and if I offered up my work often, then it counts for a lot and will be weighed in the scale right at the end...because if I don't react like this, I could be telling God...Your will be not done...because I never know what God wants me to do and sometimes it's to keep working and to keep trying...often times actually...

  

And also, when I make a lot of effort in the apostolate and there is no result...I will use it as a trigger to pray for more faith and I will remember..."It is you who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer a kingdom on you, says the Lord, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom..." When the seeds of faith, hope and love are sown and people reject them, even little children, then they are rejecting the Lord...and it is very sore for him.

  

This is something that has to be a constant topic for me in the chat. Every week...I will speak about Norms, purity and discouragement.
