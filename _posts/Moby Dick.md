My impressions from Moby Dick.

1. It's a hard book to read. The first time I tried reading it was in high school. I couldn't finish it. The second time was in university. I still couldn't finish it. The third time was a charm, in 2019-2020. 
2. The way the guy combines the styles of novel writing and play writing is astounding.
3. His facility for quoting and referencing other works, especially scripture, is next-level.
4. The main character, Captain Ahab. Wow. Speechless.

Lesson to remember. Herman Melville didn't achieve any fame for Moby Dick whilst alive. In fact I read somewhere that he died poor. It confirms my suspicion that writing, like virtue, must be it's own reward. Especially if you hit [[flow]]. That's something worth fighting for.
