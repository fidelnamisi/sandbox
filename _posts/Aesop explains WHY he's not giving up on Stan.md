synopsis: Aesop explains how Lwanda freed him from Sparta and sent him to Athens back in the day.

The air felt thick and heavy, although he was not breathing it in. The passage opened up into an archway, and he landed on the soft sand of the arena with a gentle thud.
Aesop was pacing up and down, hands behind his back, conjuring up and dismissing scenes with a wave of his hand.
"Ah, Lwanda. I didn't expect you back so soon."
"We need to talk," Stan said.
Aesop dismissed the image wafting in front of him, and sat down in one of the marble thrones. 
"What's on your mind?" he asked.
"What do you mean 'what's on my mind?' My life is ruined. I am getting into trouble at work, I can't seem to get a moment's peace, and I'm starting to fall sick."
"Yes, that's what happens every time. You have a short memory, unfortunately."
"You mean this has happened before?"
Aesop waved his hand, and streams of sand shot into the air, whirling about into different tableaux.
"Yes," he replied. "That's you in 1060 B.C. You turned aside from the path. That's you in 6 A.D. Same thing. Then you returned in 1300 A.D. That time you turned into a rock, when you again refused your calling. This is the fourth and final iteration. The rest of the Narmerians have given up on you. But I haven't. I insisted that they give you one last chance before we let go of you forever."
"Why?" Stan asked, then added quickly, "I mean, 'why do you have so much faith in me?"
"Because you had faith in me, Lwanda," Aesop replied. He pointed at the first frame that hung suspended before their eyes, and pulled it towards himself. It expanded before their eyes.
"That's your first iteration. 1060 A.D. Do you remember what happened then?"
"Of course not. I seem to have issues with my long term memory."
"So you do. It's both a blessing and a curse. It's a curse because you never remember what happened before, and so you don't learn from experience. But it's a blessing because it stops you from getting discouraged, which is what inevitably happens when we dwell too much on the past."
"So what did I do for you in 1060 A.D."
"You gave me freedom. I was a slave in Sparta."
"How could you be a slave, and yet you're a Narmerian."
"I too, like you, had forgotten my lineage and my past, and the number of times that I had been brought back. My mission was a suicidal one, which is why I kept turning away from it."
"What was it?"
"To debunk the Oracle at Delphi. I had baulked from it several times, yet the only way for me to return to my homeland and to be equal to my brethren, was by doing this. You fought for the Athenians against the Spartans, and I was part of your booty. When you brought me back to Athens, you were my master and you gave me my freedom. You don't remember any of this, but that was the first and only time that our times on Earth coincided. Shorlty after that, I made the passage, accepted my calling, went to Delphi, and the rest is history, or so they say." Whilst he spoke he rapidly pulled up and pulled down the scenes that he was speaking about, and Stan saw them playing out in the sands before his eyes.
"So you kind of owe it to me?"
"Yes. I want you to come home. And this is your last chance."
"And if I fail?"
"No one gets iterated a fifth time. This is the fourth and final time. If you fail this time, you will be banished forever into nothingness. It will be as though you never existed."
"That's impossible. No one can do that?"
"Is it really? If it's possible for you to appear in another place and time, and find that you have a different name, a different face, different memories and a different history, why is it impossible for you to be wiped out from the memories of all, and be like you had never ever existed before?"
Stan didn't have an answer to that one. Aesop continued. "There are things in this universe that not even the Narmerians can explain."
"You've seen this happening?"
"No, I haven't. And if it did happen, my ignorance of it is precisely it's proof."
Stan sat down on one of the thrones, and held his head in his hands.
"So you're telling me, that if I do not destroy this golden rhino, I will be stuck forever on earth?"
"No. Not stuck forever. I wish that were the case. You will actually disappear into nothingness. It will be as though you never existed."
"But why is it so difficult?"
"The rhino gives you your powers, Stan. When you came into contact with it, it awoke your ability to have indestructible skin, and also it brought your weakness of the shadow. Your ability gives you immense power on earth, and at each iteration, you've become addicted to that power and have not wanted to let go of it. This has been your downfall. Your desire for glory and fame, and all the pleasures that come along with it."
"Is that what happened last time?" Stan asked.
"Yes."
"Show me," he said, stepping off the throne.
Aesop stuck his hand into the leather pouch hanging from his side, and pulled out a handful of sand. 
"Are you sure?" he asked Stan. Stan nodded.
Aesop drew a deep breath, and blew a handful of sand in Stan's face. Stan felt the sand whizzing about him, stinging his skin, entering every pore of his body. He felt himself becoming lighter and lighter, leaving the ground. There was a bright light all around him, and it was getting brighter and brighter, until it became blinding.
