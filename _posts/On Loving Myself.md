#ON LOVING #MYSELF

It seems to mean two things, that are seemingly related:
1. Wanting what God wants for me. That's #loving myself.
2. Trusting that God does amazing things through the #wonder of my being, which, though I want to attribute to myself and claim the glory, honestly speaking when I look at those inspired performances when really "someone else was doing it", I simply have to tell my ego, "Dude, I wish it were me...I wish I could claim the credit... but it really isn't"... now loving and respecting that wonderful being that i cannot control-on-demand ... that's loving myself also. It means letting go of control in a way...
