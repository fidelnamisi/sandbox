<!---Thursday 01 September 2022--->

What change is to time, abundance is to space. And since God is in the now, He's more likely to be found in the abundance of space around us.

As I walked past a pair of German Shepards this morning, I felt fear because I imagined one of them pouncing on me. I realized that my imagination was the cause of my fear, and I wondered how I could quell my imagination at any given moment.

I remembered that my imagination is an interior sense, and that when I focus my attention fully on one sense, the other senses quieten down. So when I look intensely at some detail of something near me, my imagination and my other senses fall away from my perception. The same goes with my sense of touch. When I focus on the feeling of my breath in my chest or nostrils, then my imagination is ignored. This helps a lot with imaginings about the uselessness of exercise, for example, when I'm doing crunches or pull-ups.

Then I realized that God in His abundance is giving me all I need to overcome fear right now, in the moment - not via changes in time- but via abundance in space.  I guess that that is part of His love. His abundance. A love that drives out fear. The details of the trees, leaves, birds and grass all welled up around me. I noticed the ivy leaves high-fiving the morning sun, the warm breeze tickling the hairs on my arms and the splotches of bird poop on the pavement being nature's version of abstract art. A scantily clad young lady walked past me, and I looked at the brown blots on the white petals of a lily growing in a sidewalk garden. 

Girl?
