Caiphas sat in the slow moving traffic that inched along the one way street in downtown Johannesburg. He glanced at the clock on the dashboard nervously. His appointment with the sangoma was at precisely half past ten, and this sangoma was in high demand. He had come highly recommended to him by his friend, Mxolisi.
"Dude, trust me, he solved my problem at work. I think that's his area," Mxolisi had said to him over the phone when he told him about the announcement made at the office the day before.
"But he's from East Africa," Caiphas said.
"So what? That doens't mean anything," Mxolisi replied.
"Don't you know any sangomas from Mzansi?" 
"My man, put that thing out of your head my guy. He's good. Sure I know other ones. There's this one whose an expert with relationships. When I was trying to get together with Dineo, I went to see him."
"Yeah, send me his numbers also."
"Are you still trying with that Elsie chick?"
"Yeah, sort of."
"Why's it taking so long, bro?"
"I don't know. Just send me his numbers. I'll go and see him after I see this Mwendwa guy, okay?"
Mxolisi hung up, and a few seconds later, Caiphas received two text messages on his phone, with two phone numbers of diviners who were well known in Johannesburg. He immediately sent a message to the first one, Mwendwa, because his employment problem was a little bit more pressing than his relationship challenges. Mwendwa replied shortly therefter, setting up an appointment for the following Tuesday. Because he was the Museum Manager, and Tesfaye wasn't around, giving himself leave to go and see Mwendwa was not even a question.

He finally turned off the main road and snaked his way into a narrow street that was next to some inner city apartments. A homeless looking man, who nevertheless wore a green reflective vest, motioned him over to a spot where he could park the car. As Caiphas stepped out of the car, they wordlessly agreed that the man would keep an eye on his car, and Caiphas would pay him upon his return. Caiphas stepped onto the sidewalk and looked up at the rows and rows of windows that rose above him. Mwendwa was in one of them. He wondered which one. He pulled out his cellphone and opened the text message that he had received from Mwendwa.

"Horus Apartments. Fifth floor. Number seventeen." He looked at the steps that led up to the entrance of the apartment building. A little sign above the doorway read "Horus Apartments." Caiphas put his phone back in his pocket and hurried towards the entrance, fearing that he would miss his appointment because he was five minutes late.  He hurriedly filled in his name, phone number and the flat he was visiting in the big black book that lay open in front of the uniformed guard at the reception.
"Lifts?" he asked. The guard nodded towards them. They were further down the passage. Caiphas thanked his lucky stars. He was in no way inclined to go up five flights of stairs.
A few minutes later, he was standing outside door number seventeen. He had expected to see a sign at the door, or some kind of marking to distinguish it as being an office, not just a home, like the other apartments were. But if it hadn't been for the message that he had received, he would have walked straight past the cream door with the black number painted on it, because it looked exactly the same as every other door on that passage.

He waited for a response, growing impatient as he glanced at his watch. It was now twenty minutes to eleven, meaning that he was a full ten minutes late. Unacceptable, he thought to himself, as he knocked on the door again, a little more forcefully this time. The door opened a crack. 

A young girl stood there. She must have been thirteen or fourteen years old, even though the make up that she wore made her look slightly older.  She wore a t-shirt and jeans, and her hair was neatly brushed into a tight bun behind her head. 
"Are you Caiphas?" she asked. She spoke in Sotho. Caiphas replied in Zulu. "Yes."
"You're late," she replied. She spun around and walked into the apartment. Caiphas followed her in. The first thing Caiphas noticed was the odd smell. Something was rotten, and it made Caiphas want to get out of the house as soon as he possibly could. This was in stark contrast to the rest of the room, which was tastefully and comfortably finished. There was a set of white couches, a flatscreen televisionand a glass coffee table. There were several magazines arranged in a neat pile on top of it. Despite the overwhelming smell, Caiphas thought that this was a place where one could live quite comfortably.
Caiphas had been so distracted with the living room that he hadn't noticed the girl step out of the room, and he only realized that she had left when she stepped back into the living room through a door that he saw led into a short corridor.
"Mwendwa will see you now. But you have to pay first," she said. "Are you paying cash or card?"
"Can I pay with my card?"
"Sure," she said, as she stepped back into the corridor. She emerged a moment later with a cellphone and a tiny device nestled on top of it. Caiphas gave her his card. She swiped it against the device.
"That's six fifty, right?"
"Right," Caiphas said. She handed his phone back to him. He took it, keyed in his pin and handed it back to her. A second later, his phone buzzed with an incoming text message. It was from his bank, notifiying him of money that had gone out of his account. Caiphas was impressed, but kept his mouth shut.
"Come with me," the girl said, leading Caiphas into the short corridor. She immediately pointed to a doorway on their left. The door had been taken out and in its place hung a curtain of dark brown beads. 
"Please wait there," she said, parting the beaded curtain with her hand. "The prophet will be with you shortly." Caiphas stepped through the curtain and into the room. 

The room was dark. He could make out a little reed mat on the floor near the doorway. He figured that that was what the girl had meant. He sat down on the reed mat and looked around him.  The thick, beaded curtain that he had walked through let in some light. The only other source of light was a tiny window right near the ceiling. It was browning, cracked and closed. Caiphas shifted uncomfortably. The reed mat was bumpy and uncomfortable. There was another grass mat directly opposite him. "This must be the prophet's", he thought to himself.  A strange odour wafted into his nose. It reminded him of sour milk, smelly socks and rotting meat, all rolled into one.  It gave him a weird sense of foreboding.  Like terrible things had happened in that room. Things that could not be spoken and were better yet forgotten, though the stench of them would never go away. Steeling himself against the smell, he took a deep breath to calm his nerves and surveyed the rest of the room. All around the walls of the room were little bunches of herbs, tied up and hanging from the wall at irregular intervals. Here and there, he spotted what looked like tiny skulls. He was not sure what they belonged to. They looked more reptilian than anything else. And there was a chill in the air. Despite the warm temparature of the living room outside that he had experienced a few minutes before, the room was cold. The cold was starting to set into his limbs. He frowned. This was a very bad idea. He was leaving right then and there. He wondered why he had even let Mxolisi talk him into doing this. He was getting up. He was going. That's it. He was done.

Then he heard the steady plod of footsteps. They seemed to be coming from the direction opposite to the living room, from further down the passage.

The steps got louder and louder as they approached the door. He groaned. It was too late now. The plodding footsteps came to a halt right outside the curtain. Caiphas made out a vague shadow on the other side of the curtain. He didn't see them, bur rather felt -  a pair of eyes watching him. Burning into his soul. Almost seeing through him. Fear washed through every bone in his body. He wilted beneath that stare. He wanted to get it over with as quickly as possible. He wanted to leave. There was an odd shuffling noise, followed by a wheezing cough, and then the beaded curtains parted.

A wizened old man made his way though the curtains. Caiphas was surprised. He realized that he had been expecting to see a much younger man. But Mwendwa was old. Caiphas placed him in his seventies. That made him even more scary and forbidding. Caiphas shifted uncomfortably on his mat and cleared his throat, his heart pounding in his chest.  The old man bent forward as he slinked through the beaded curtains and hobbled into the room. He had a thick white beard, and a thick head of hair. It looked impressive. He had a leather pouch slung around his neck.  In his hands he carried a wooden bowl, a pestle and a short club. The man sat down on a grass mat opposite Caiphas. 

His face was deeply wrinkled. He simply sat there and stared at Caiphas through a pair of bloodshot eyes. Caiphas shifted again.
"Hello," Caiphas greeted him in English.
"Where are you from?" Mwendwa replied, in Sotho.
"Johannesburg."
"You're Sepedi," Mwendwa continued, in flawless Sotho. Caiphas nodded, even though it was more of a statement and less of a question. 
"Yes, from my father's side."
"And your mother is from Ghana?" Caiphas was a bit taken aback by the question. How had the man known that. 
"Yes. She was from Ghana."
"She is dead?" Caiphas nodded.
"And that is why you are here today? You want to know what she wants you to do." 
"No," Caiphas shook his head. "I am having trouble at work. I told you in the message, remember?"
"Yes, you did. But I have many clients, and I am getting old. My memory isn't what it used to be," he said, taking off the purse that hung around his neck. "But I can sense that your mother is unhappy with you. There's something there that you haven't done. Something that you haven't sorted out yet."
Caiphas gulped. This was news to him. 
"Ah, okay. But maybe we can handle that first issue and then we can get back to the other one."
"Suit yourself," Mwendwa replied, "but I warn you, it may prove entirely useless if your mother is unhappy. There are some spirits that are just too powerful, and you can't just forget about them."
He opened the leather pouch and held it out under Caiphas's face. It was full of shells, beads and small bits of bone. Caiphas just stared at it, unsure what to do. 
"Blow," Mwendwa said. Caiphas blew on the purse. Mwendwa tipped the contents of the purse onto the floor. He rolled them about gently with his club. Caiphas looked on, fascinated.  Mwendwa made several grunting noises, then leaned back and smiled.
"Tell me about the situation at work," he said.
"There's been a bit of a shake-up," Caiphas started. "Heads are going to roll."
"Is yours one of them?" Mwendwa asked.
"Yes, possibly. But that's what I am trying to prevent. There's a new position that's going to be opening up soon in the department, you see---,"
"What department?"
"Sports and Recreation. I work at the Pan African Heritage Museum."
"I know that place. I've been there once."
"Really?" Caiphas asked, trying to remember if he'd ever spotted Mwendwa there. But for the life of him, he couldn't place him if he had. Besides, they had thousands of visitors every month. There was simply no way that Caiphas could remember all of them.
"Yes. Your exhibitions are really interesting."
"Thank you," Caiphas said. "But they might shut the place down soon, and there's a job in the MEC's office that I've been eyeing for a long time. It's three times the pay," he added.
"And you've applied for it?"
"Just this morning," Caiphas said. "I sent in my CV and everything before coming here."
"And you want to know your chances?"
"I want a guarantee."
"Let's see what the bones say," Mwendwa said, poking at the bones and moving them about with the end of his stick. He stared at them, poked about a bit more, and stared at them again.
"I see," he said, finally.
"See what?" 
"It's very simple. You have to go to your friend at the department ---"
"How do you know I have a friend at the department---"
"It's the bones," Mwendwa said, and continued, "You have to go to your friend at the department, and offer him something small. Then it will all come right."
"You mean a bribe?"
"I said something small."
"And once I give him that something small, what's going to happen."
"The job will be yours --- at least that's what the bones say," Mwendwa said, looking up at Caiphas.
"That's all?"
"That's it."
"And you can guarantee this?"
"The only thing I can guarantee is that you'll die one day," Mwendwa said, smiling. Caiphas wasn't sure how to respond to that. Mwendwa started collecting the bones and putting them back inside the pouch.
"Are you finished?"
"Yes," Mwendwa said, hanging the pouch around his neck again. "Unless there's something else?" Caiphas wanted to ask him about his mother, but then decided against it.
"No, that's all."
"Have a nice day," Mwendwa said, standing up and hobbling to the door, "My assistant will show you out."

Caiphas walked out the Horus Apartment building feeling cheated. How could the diviner tell him that the answer to his problems lay in paying a bribe? He could have worked that out for himself, and put the money that he had just spent towards paying the bribe. The hobo in the reflective vest came running up to him. Caiphas took out a coin and threw it at him.
"Is that all, bozza?" the hobo asked. Caiphas ignored him as he stepped into his car, turned on the engine and peeled into the heavy traffic. As he sat in the one way road, inching along, his thoughts drifted back to the meeting that he had just had. What a waste of time it had been. Still, if he hadn't had gone up there to meet the diviner, he would simply not have thought about giving whomever it was that he was supposed to give a bribe to. His mind wandered to his next quandary. Who did he know at the departmnet. He furrowed his brow, deep in thought. The face came to him like a flash, even before the name did. 
"Kgotso!" he said aloud, baning his hand on the steering wheel. He had stopped at a red light, and he pulled his cellphone out of his pocket and connected it to the blue tooth system of his car. He went through the contacts on his phone, and came across the name he was looking for. "Kgotso - MEC's office."
The car behind him honked it's horn. He looked up ahead. The light had turned green. Caiphas dialed the number as he put his car into gear and crawled through the intersection.
The phone started ringing. Caiphas was on the edge of his seat, driving slowly through the traffic in downtown Johannesburg. 
"Come on, come on, pick up," he said aloud.
"Hello---," a voice came on the other side of the line.
"Kgotso!" Caiphas shouted, ecstatic. "How are you man? Long time."
"Ey, Caiphas. How you doing man. It's been a while. You good?"
"Yeah, I'm good bra. I'm good. Listen man. We need to catch up. There's something we need to discuss. It's quite urgent. And I think you'll find it very interesting."
