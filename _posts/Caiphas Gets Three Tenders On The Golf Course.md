Caiphas and Tshepo were on one of the greens next to the golf course beside Tshepo's houes. It was a Wednesday morning, and they were watching the slender, middle-aged getting ready to tee-off. Though they wanted to give him the space and time he needed to concentrate, the man seemed more interested in continuing with his conversation.
"We are under a lot of pressure from the department to get going with the houses," he said, as he took a step back and assessed the distance that he had to drive his golf ball. "How far did you say this one is?"
"Ninety five metres" Caiphas replied.
"That's a bit far," the man replied, scratching his head uncertainly.
"Vuyo, if I may," Tshepo said, walking up to the man and holding out a larger golf club. "That one's overkill," he said, nodding towards the club that the man held in his hands.
"Ah, you're probably right," the man replied, taking the club and lining up a shot. He smascked the ball hard, and it sailed through the air, veered left, and disappeared into a clump of bushes on the left. Tshepo and Caiphas burst put sniggering. Vuyo looked cross for a second, then burst out laughing himself.
"I'm sorry MEC," Caiphas said between chortles, "but that's the third ball you've lost this morning."
"I guess I am out of shape," Vuyo responded.
"That's the price of being MEC," Tshepo said. "You don't get much time off work to practice."
"No, you don't," Vuyo replied, nodding sagely. "We are always under pressure to deliver, and there are all sorts of reviews happeneing a;ll thetime, then you've got the service delivery protests. That one in Eesterust last week was terrible."
"It was two people that died, right?" Caiphas asked, picking up his golf bag and lugging it across the fairway. The other two men followed him.
"It was actually three," Vuyo said, "And that just added to the pressure. As usual, the media blamed us. So," he turned towards Caiphas as they walked, "Will you accept the job?"
Caiphas wrinkled his brow. "I don't know, Vuyo. You do realize that you guys have approved three tenders in the last two weeks."
"Yes, I am aware," Vuyo answered, as he scanned the nearby bushes.
"What are people going to say?" Caiphas asked.
"We don't want to face accusations of corruption," Tshepo added, leading the way to the edge of the bushes, where he started poking around with his golf club. "I think it fell around here, right?"
"Yes, I know that it could seem that way, but I assure," Vuyo said, taking a step into the bushes, "that nothing could be further from the case. All the procedures and processes were followed. If they did a forensic audit, they would find nothing untoward, I can assure you that."
"I'm just not sure," Caiphas said. "It's too much work coming our way, and I don't want to be in a position where we don't deliver, and it reflects badly both on us and on you."
"I know, I know, and I appreciate your predicament," Vuyo said, with a wave of his hand. "But if you did this favour for us, I'd appreciate and remember it for a long time," he said, meaningfully. "There are simply not that many qualifying companies that have your track record and that we know and we trust."
"But why now?" Caiphas asked, glancing at his father and wondering why he was so quiet, "I mean, three tenders in three weeks? That's unheard of."
"Well, yes and no. You have to consider that you put in the applications last year, and the provincial budgets only got approved last month."
"I think the ball went a little further in," Tshepo said, pointing deeper into the clump of bushes with his golf club. "Maybe we should just leave it. I'm not going in there," he said, with a chuckle.
"I'm not letting this golf ball go, gentlemen," Vuyo said, looking determined. "Give me two minutes. It's in here somewhere. I'll find it if it's the last thing I do. My pride is at stake." And with that, he dove into the bushes, whacking them this way and that, searching for the missing golf ball. Tshepo drew Caiphas aside.
"Great work, son," Tshepo whispered to Caiphas.
"Huh? What do you mean?"
"You're playing hard to get. That's good. We can never come across as looking desperate."
Caiphas nodded and grinned. "Thanks," he said, glad to have met his father's approval.
"Found it!" Vuyo shouted, emerging from bushes, holding the golf ball aloft in his hands triumphantly. He set it on the grass, and drove it towards the green.
"Aah, that's much better," he said, as his ball soared through the air, rising gently, and landed just a few metres off a sand trap. 
"Good shot, MEC," Caiphas said, as they picked up their golf bags and trudged towards the hole. "It seems that today's your lucky day."
"So that does that mean that you'll do it? You know I've got other ways in which I can force you to do it," he added with a sly grin.
"That won't be necessary," Caiphas said, stretching out his hand for a handshake. "We will do it."
"Now that's what I like to hear," Vuyo said, taking Caiphas's hand in his own and giving him a warm handshake.
