It struck me with some level of force that as Jesus was being attacked by his enemies, He kept them in existence by a constant and deliberate act of His will. The gift of existence is something that God gives even to those who hate Him, as they continue hating Him. It seems like meeting malice with kindness is part of being childlike.
