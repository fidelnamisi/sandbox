### At Elsie's behest, Stan decides to bring in the East Africa Exhibition.

**Synopsis**  


**Text**  
Elsie stepped into the open plan office and her eyes were immediately drawn to Stan, seated at his desk behind his laptop. She took a deep breath. She had been dreading that moment all the previous night and thus far into the morning. But she knew she had to go through with it. So, to console herself, she told herself that it would be just as hard for him as it was for her, and she walked over to Stan.
"Stan, what's the next temporary exhibition that we have lined up?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant.
"I think it's the Khoi San rock art one," Stan replied, clicking away at his laptop and also trying to sound unconcerned. "But let me just check."
"We need to bring in something else. Something that's not local," she added, pulling her chair back and taking a seat.
"What do you have in mind?"
"Egypt?" she asked hopefully.
"No can do," Stan said, shaking his head. "It's in high demand, and we're not getting it in again until next year."
"How about something from West Africa?" she asked.
"Why the sudden need for something from overseas?" Stan asked.
Elsie's mind worked quickly. She had to come up with a good answer without betraying the secret that Professor Tesfaye had just entrusted to her. "After my meeting with Chichi this morning, I realised that if we want to get more learners and school tours in here, and have a bigger impact, we actually need to push the foreign exhibitions more. It's the way kids think," she added, "if it's foreign it's more exciting."
"But we've always known that," Stan countered stubbornly. "The problem has always been how expensive the foreign ones ares are." Elsie bit her lip. She hated it when Stan got argumentative, and secretly wondered if he was just being himself, or if he was trying deliberately to give her a hard time.
"How expensive what is?" Gugu asked, walking in with two cups of steaming coffee. He placed one in front of Stan.  "Do you want a cup?" he asked her.
"No,  thanks," she said. She quickly explained to Gugu what they were discussing. Gugu scratched the tiny scraps of beard on his chin. 
"I think I might have a solution," he said. They both looked at him expectantly.
"Jane Koske," he said.
"Who's that?" Stan asked.
"The Head Curator at the Nairobi Heritage Archives. She and I have been," he searched for the words, blushing, "--- er, messaging each other over the past couple of months."
"Are you sure it's only been messaging?" Stan shot an accusing look at him. "Hey, she's cute, she's foreign and we have a lot in common," Gugu answered defensively. "Anyway, that's not the point. The point is that they want to build a stronger relationship with museums across Africa. Not in that sense, man," he said in response to to Stan's leer. "Get your head out the gutter. Anyway, I'm ignoring you," he said, turning to Elsie. "I was saying Elsie, before I was rudely interrupted,"
"I didn't interrupt you,"
"Can you two just get on with it?" Elsie said, shaking her head. These two could be such idiots sometimes.
"Right, Jane Koske is probably the person to get in touch with. She told me that they've had some new stuff come in that's been part of their permanent exhibition now for over a year. And they are more than happy to share."
"That's fantastic. The Treaures of East Africa -- it's has a nice ring to it, " Elsie said, with a faraway look in her eyes.
"No way. 'Treasures' is overused. The Magic of East Africa. Or the Mysteries of the East. Or the Secrets of ---"
"Okay, okay," Elsie interrupted him. "Coming up with names is your department." She stood up. "I have a tour starting in fifteen minutes. Will you and Stan handle the Jane thing?" she asked, as she picked up a notebook and pen at her desk. 
"I'm sure Jabs would be more than happy to 'handle' Jane," Stan said, grinning.
"Yeah, whatever. Gugu, you'll get on top of it?"
"He'd love to," Stan cackled. Gugu shot him a cross look.
"Alright, alright, whatever, I give up," Elsie muttered, striding away. "Stan, don't forget your handling the permanent display today."
"Why? I've got other stuff I've got to finish today," Stan complained.
"I'm only working half day today, remember? We discussed it last week and I put it on the calendar." she said as she walked out. "See you at reception in five."
Stan eyes narrowed. He hated being bossed around and he knew that Elsie knew that. He wondered if she was being that way just to get back at him. Gugu gave him a pat on the shoulder. 
"Sorry, bro. I told you. Office romances - bad idea."
"Shut up," Stan muttered, turning back to him computer.


**Notes**  
Elsie turned to Chichi. 
"Okay

Elsie sat at the reception, typing a press release on the computer. Even though she had a degree in marketing, she had never been able to get a job, and she accepted the receptionist position at the Museum because it was the only thing available. And she needed the income to put her three year old daughter, Lwazi, in creche. She couldn't believe how expensive creches were these days. But what she found harder still to believe was how hard it was to find someone that she could settle down with.

When she first met Stan, she wasn't interested in pursuing a relationship. She had made it clear up front that she had baggage, that she was keeping very focused on raising her daughter, holding onto her job and looking for better prospects as they came along. It was Stan who had pursued her. It was Stan who had been all romantic and had insisted on taking her out on dates, spending time with her and Lwazi, and starting a serious relationship. At the age of twenty five, she was one year older than he was, and she knew that that might give rise to complications, because she was a little bit more mature than he was. Scratch that. Way more mature. That's why he bolted when she brought up the whole marriage conversation.

Chichi broke her train of thought as she came and sat beside her. Even though she was white and from the other side of the tracks, Elsie was grateful to have another female that she could at least vent about her man problems to.

"What are you busy with," Chichi asked, squeezing into the chair beside Elsie.
"I'm just doing a press release for the new East African exhibition."
"Don't we have one already?"
"Yeah, but I think I can write better than those agency people. Besides, they're doing nothing to push it on social media. So I'm just coming up with a social media schedule to drive some attendance during the month the exhibition is here. You take photographs, don't you?"
"Yes, but not good enough to put online, that's for sure."
"Please, friend. The agency people just posted photos straight off the web. They don't have any photos of the artefacts here in their new home. And that makes a difference. When people can see other people interacting with the space."
"You've got this marketing thing down, hey. Are you still looking for a job?"
"Yeah, but there aren't too many openings."
"You've got to be kidding me. You're a young, black woman with a degree."
"I've got the wrong degree. I should've studied accounting or finance or something like that."
"Maybe it's not too late, though."
"It sure as hell is. I've got a mouth to feed, remember?"
"How's Lwazi doing?" 
"She's growing every day. She just needs a dad. I don't know what's worse. For a boy to grow up without a father or for a girl to grow up without a father."
"Yeah, it's hard to find good men nowadays, hey."
"What's it like though for white people?"
Chichi was about to answer, when she fell silent. Stan and Gugu had just walked in. The temperature in the room dropped by a few degrees.  He nodded at both of them, inwardly cursing himself for being so lost in conversation that he forgot to take a detour. 
"Morning, ladies."
"Morning, guys" Chichi replied, cheerily.  "Morning, Gugu," Elsie said, turning back to her computer and carrying on typinng. Chichi tried to make her smile even brighter, to sort of compensate for Elsie. Stan nodded again, and headed off down the passage towards the offices.
"You guys broke up?" she asked, as soon as Stan and Gugu were out of sigh. Elsie nodded.
"When?"
"I moved out last night."
