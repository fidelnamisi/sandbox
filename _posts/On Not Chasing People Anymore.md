# On Not Chasing People Anymore

  One of the hardest things to do in life, is to cease being an enabler of other people's vices, because, at the surface level it may seem like a lack of love, but at a deeper level, it is a truer expression of wanting the best for the person loved.

 I have seen with my own eyes how much the family of an alcoholic battles with the decision to let them hit rock bottom so that they themselves, of their own will, and driven only the upright intention of becoming the man they are meant to be, will decide to change their lives.

In the same way, I have battled and still battle with the decision to let people hit their own rock bottoms in the apostolate, so that they can wake up for themselves. Because I fear that I am not being loving, whatever that means. But when I ask myself what is the best thing for the men I love, then the answer is patently clear: they must become men of desires. Of their own volition, they must decide to change their lives. This lack of ease at #chasing people has sat with me now for over a decade. There must be some truth to it.
