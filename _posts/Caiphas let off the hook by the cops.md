Caiphas walked out of his father's office feeling like he was a new man. Everything that he had ever wanted, everything that he had ever dreamt of, was coming true. He could already see the article that the jounrnalists would now print about him, how he fell from grace, and clawed his way back to it overnight. What a comeback.
"Sorry, sir?" 
It was the receptionist, standing on the landing between the two flights of stairs. 
"Yes?"
"There's someone here to see you." 
Something about her manner put Caiphas on edge.
"Who?" he asked, his heart beating just a little bit faster.
"The police."

Caiphas showed the policeman and the policewoman whom he had earlier seen at the museum into his office, and bade them sit down.
"Would you like some tea or coffee?"
"No, not at all," the policewoman responded. Her colleague seemed a little bit miffed at the reply, but since she was his superior, he just had to comply with the boss. "We will only be a short while," she continued.
"How can I be of assistance," Caiphas asked, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest.
"We just have some questions about Thursday night. The night of the break-in at the museum. You say that you were there last night and were the last one to leave?"
"Yes, yes I was. Why?"
"Did you notice anything strange or out of place?"
"No, nothing stood out that night. Everything seemed pretty normal to me. Elsie and I just had dinner, and then we left."
"Why didn't you set the alarms?"
"The system hasn't worked in a long time. I know because I tried to get it fixed when I took over the restaurant, and it was such a headache because the system was all interconnected and old. I was in the process of paying out of my own pocket for a complete overhaul, but we just hadn't finished."
"Ah, okay."
"Any leads about the guard's killer?"
"Yes, we have found the man."
"Really?" Caiphas' eyes widened. "Who? How?"
"It seems that Bongani had some gambling debts, and there was one in particular which was causing him a lot of trouble. The man who he owed is in custody now. He was seen the day before having a violent argument with the deceased."
"That's terrible. What's going to happen to his family? Maybe I should send them some money to help out."
"Yes, that would be a good idea," the policeman finally spoke up, as his eyes swept across Caiphas's office, and out into the well manicured lawns. "Funerals are very expensive nowadays."
"Yes, you're right. I'll send them a good amount. Two, three thousand."
"That's very kind of you. It will be much appreciated by the family," the policewoman said.
"Ah, it was the least I could do, really. That's terrible. Being in debt, being murdered for it, and then leaving behind a family swimming in even more debt. The world is a cruel place, I can tell you," Caiphas said, shaking his head.
"We've seen worse things," the policewoman said, standing up, "Still, that money will go a long way."
Caiphas and the policeman stood up also. "Thank you for your time."
"But it still doesn't explain the stolen object, from the museum."
The policewoman laughed. "When you've been a policewoman for as long as I have, you come to accept that there are some mysteries which can never ever be solved."
The other policeman burst out laughing. Caiphas forced himself to join them in their guffawing as he led them out the door and down the stairs.
