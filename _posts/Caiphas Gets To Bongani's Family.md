Chichi was seated behind her desk, browsing through different job search website and posting her CV in response to different job callouts. The glass doors slid open and Caiphas strode in. She looked up with a beaming smile, and closed the windows that were open on her computer surreptitiously.
"Hi, Chichi."
"Morning Mr. Chuene. What can I do you for?"
"Do you have Bongani's address - I mean, the address of his family? I want to go over there and pay my respects, and quite possibly make a donation or contribution or something."
"Sure thing," Chichi said, pulling out a post it note and opening up the address book application on her computer. "You do realize that the funeral was last week though, right?"
"Yes, and I feel terrible about having missed it."
"Ag, it's fine," Chichi said, scribbling an address on the post it note and handing it to Caiphas. "Better late than never. I'm sure they will appreciate whatever token you can give them."
"That's what I was thinking," Caiphas said, taking the note and glancing at it. "This is close by, isn't it?"
"Yeah, like ten minutes away by car."
"Awesome! Thanks." Caiphas folded the note in half and put it in his shirt pocket as he walked out.

A few minutes later, he was pulling up in front of a little housefront in the Steynville township. The house was very poor and in an advanced state of disrepair. That was the thing about houses in the township. You could have two people living side by side, who were in completely different socio-economic classses. Caiphas mused about this as he took in the neighbours house with is light brown face brick walls, burglar barred windows, tiled driveway and small, neat garden. Then he turned to the house in front of him, with a little piece of wood hanging for dear life from the dilapidated gate. "Number 3712". There was no garden to speak of, the windows were cracked and broken, and the yard was full of scrap. Caiphas scoured the ground for a pebble, found one, and used it to rap on the rusty metal gate. After knocking on it for a few minutes, a short, chubby woman walked out. She was dressed in a black skirt and sandals, and wore a black headwrap that covered her hair completely. Caiphas took her to be Bongani's wife. She didn't say anything, but just gave him a "So what do you want?" kind of look.
Caiphas cleared his throat. "Hi, my name is Caiphas. I worked with Bongani."
The woman's face fell, and she slowly opened the gate without another word. Caiphas stepped in. "I just came to pay my respects," he added, "And just to give you something small to say sorry and to help with the costs."
"Please come in," the woman replied, turning around and leading the way in, leaving the gate open. 

Caiphas followed her into the house. She used a different door from the one that she walked out of, leading Caiphas into the living room.
"Please, sit down," she said, nodding towards a threadbare couch that was covered in a kind of knitted shawl. It creaked loudly as Caiphas sank into it, and he felt the chair springs stabbing into his backside. The woman sat opposite him, folding her arms and legs.
"I'm Nkosazana," she started. 
"Bongani's wife?" 
"Yes," she nodded.
"I'm really sorry about your loss."
She shrugged. "It happens. That's life. We just make the most of it." They lapsed into an awkward silence. Caiphas realized that they must have been quite hard up, because she didn't even offer him a cup of tea or a glass of water or anything, breaking all the unwritten rules of hospitality that he was accustomed to.
"How are the children?"
"The children are fine."
"How many do you have?"
"Four," she said, rocking back and forth in her chair, slowly. "Two are grown and two are still in school. The ones in school are a lot of trouble. We cope by God's grace."
"Yes, that's true," Caiphas said, pulling out his bulging wallet from his back pocket. Nkosazan's eyes widened in interest as Caiphas opened up the wallet, and flicked through some stiff notes.
"I just wanted to give you something small, just to assist with some of the expenses and buying things around the house," Caiphas said, with a glance at the threadbare couch and the old television set mounted on a rickety looking table in the corner. He pulled out a wad of notes, and handed them towards Nkosazana. 
She got up and took them in two outstretched hands, doing a little courtsey as the took the money. "Oh,thank you. Thank you so much," she said. "God bless you." She stepped out of the lounge and returned an instant later, putting the money into a small, black leather handbag. "It will really go a long way. Can I offer you a cup of tea or something to drink?"
"No, I'm fine, thank you," Caiphas said, rising to his feet. Almost as an afterthought, he added, "Have you had any progress with finding the person that---." Not sure of the politically correct term to use so as not to bring up bad memories, he faltered for lack of the term to use.
"No, not yet. I think the police have closed the case. The mashonisa they arrested proved that he was somewhere else at the time, and there were witnesses there with him, so they let him go."
"I actually wanted to speak to you about that," Caiphas said, "May I sit down?" He did so even before she could respond. She followed suit, and gazed at him questioningly. Caiphas cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
"I have a proposal for you," he started. "You see that money that I gave you?" The widow nodded slowly. "Yes?" she mumbled, eyes narrowing.
"What if," Caiphas continued, "I told you that you could get a whole lot more of it. Enough to buy yourself a new house, move out of here and finish paying off your children's school fees?" 
Nkosazana's eyes widened.
"I'm listening."
