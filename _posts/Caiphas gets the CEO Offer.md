synopsis: Caiphas gets the CEO offer from his father. He accepts it on condition that the powers of the board are limited. ENDS WITH Tshepo accepting his conditions.
---

Monday morning found Caiphas pulling into the old mansion that served as the Chuene Holdings office. His father had called him late the previous night and requested to see him urgently, first thing in the morning. Even though Caiphas knew what it was about, he didn't let anything on. He wanted to act surprised and not give Lerato away, since she had made him swear that he would keep quiet about it.

He pulled into his space in the parking lot, and took out his phone. He quickly scanned the news headlines to see if there was anything about the man he had murdered. There was lots of news of murders and killings all over the country, but the newspapers seemed to focus more on deaths related to protest marches, armed robberies and terrorist attacks. He slipped his phone back into his pocked, and walked into the building. The receptionist beamed at him, and he gave her a curt nod, and proceeded up the stairs, taking two at a time.

He knocked twice on his father's door. 
"Yes?" said Tshepo.
"Can I come in," Caiphas said, cracking the door open. 
"Ah, the man of the hour," Tshepo said, standing up and walking out from behind his desk. "How are you, son?"
Caiphas was a little taken aback by this greeting. The last time he had spoken to his father, things had been tense. He knew that the tables had turned, but he hadn't realised by how much.
"I'm fine, I guess. All things considered." 
"What do you mean," Tshepo asked, gesturing Caiphas towards the couch that was on the wall opposite his large desk. Caiphas sat and Tshepo sat beside him.
"No, no big deal. Just working things out at the new restaurant, getting it going properly and stuff. When are you coming through to visit? I thought having a restaurant was your dream, not mine."
"Indeed it is. And I'm starting to wonder whether or not I should step into it now, and take early retirement. What would think about trading places?"
Caiphas forced a smile. "What do you mean, old man? You want me to become chairman? I don't see that happening."
"Not exactly chairman," Tshepo said, standing up and pacing towards the window. "But CEO. Remember that old position you were interested in?" he asked, turning around to face Caiphas once more. "It's available again. If you'll have it."
"What?"
"Comes as a surprise, doesn't it?" Tshepo laughed softly. "It was also a surprise for the board, trust me. We thought that we had the right man for the job, but just last week, he pulled out."
"But how could he do that? Wasn't he meant to have started just around now?"
"Yes, but he kept stalling on signing the contract. We thought that he wanted more money and benefits, and we kept making him better offers. Eventually the board got tired and laid down an ultimatum. And he walked."
Caiphas shook his head in disbelief.
"We don't know if he got a better offer, or he just got cold feet. He just said that there were some personal issues that came up in his life that he needed to deal with, and that was it."
"He got a better offer," Caiphas said, bitterly.
"I think so too. The pity is that he kept us waiting so long - sorry - correction - kept you waiting so long."
"But I thought that the board had zero interest in me. Aren't I too young?"
"Yes, but I prevailed upon them. It was one of those gut feel things, you know? In the back of my head I knew that it was the right thing to do. So when we met last week to discuss who else to approach, I put your case forward very strongly. So strongly in fact, that I convinced them. At first I was doubting whether or not I had done the right thing, and to be honest with you, up until last night I was still doubting, hey. But then, suddenly, last night, I knew you were the right candidate, and that I must just let the ball keep on rolling."
"What do you mean you just knew."
"I don't know," Tshepo shrugged. "I just --- knew."
Caiphas quickly thought back to his apartment, the obelisk, the fire the previous night. Could it be that what the odd man he had met at the "Crossroads" had told him was all coming true?
"But what if I'm not interested anymore?" he asked. Tshepo's face fell. This was an eventuality that he was not expecting.
"What do you mean you're not interested anymore. You yourself said you were willing to kill for this job."
"And I have- I mean - am willing - to kill for this job, but ---" he searched for the words, "the way I was treated was shameful, quite frankly."
"And that's exactly what I said to the board. That's why they are willing to reach you half way in terms of what you'd like - salary, benefits, the works. You name it."
"You're kidding, right?" 
"No, I'm not. But it's your company at the end of the day. Don't bleed yourself dry."
Caiphas head spun quickly. He knew precisely what he wanted. Not money. Not benefits. No all expenses paid holidays in the Bahamas. He wanted power and control.
"I want to never have to defer to the board again. That situation that happened when we ran out of money to finish the construction and I got treated like a little school boy? That will never happen again."
Tshepo furrowed his brow for a second, then looked up and shrugged. 
"It's your call. If that's what you want, that's what you want."
