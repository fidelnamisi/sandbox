"You're late again, Oyama."

His boss had a thing of calling him by his surname. He wasn't sure if it was because he was a member of Black First Land First, or was a bully, or was just a straight-up idiot. He was all of those three things wrapped into one. Caiphas was one of those guys for whom every day is gym day but no day is leg day. Stan had once asked him about it, and his response was that although guys look at girls legs, the coverse was not necessary true. Therefore he thought it best to focus his time and attention on his chest and arms.

"What did I tell you about being late?"

"But we're only opening at half past nine today. It's the off-season."
"I don't care. Rules are rules. And we pay you to work from nine to five. On season. Off season. Weekends. Public holidays. Whenever."
"Who's we?"
'What?"
"You said "we" pay you. You don't pay me anything, last I checked."

Caiphas clicked his tongue in disgust and wandered off towards the canteen area. Stan smiled to himself. Even though Caiphas was only one year older than he was, and his direct boss, the guy acted as if he owned the damn place.

Stan walked off in the opposite direction. He was hungry and would have given anything for a quick coffee and a doughnut. But he felt that it would be safer at that moment to give Caiphas some space and let him blow off some steam after he'd just put him in his place.

Stan walked in through the complex doors and went towards the staff offices. These are located at the back of the complex. The front of the complex was where the museum and the restaurant were situated. The museum was a large building that had been sub-divided into sections, each section representing a different part of South Africa, and Africa's history. After six months of working there first as an intern and then as a trainee, Stan knew the place quite well. 

People found it weird, but his favourite section was the "prehistoric" display. He had given a name to each one of the skulls he'd found in there. There was the one that reminded him of his cousin, Veli. It had that distinctive hammerhead shape that had given him endless hours of quiet mirth whenever Velk visited. thete wax also the he had named Jemima. not that he kknew any Jemima. But it just reminded him of a Jemima. Then there was Veronica. Named after his old school teacher. And Luyanda. This one was the homo sapiens sample skull. The specialists said that it daetd back from soomething like 1000 b.c. or soemthing crazy like that. But Stan wasnt convinced. He harboured a sneaking suspiction that the museum director, Professor Tesfaye, had snuck into a morgue one day and taken possession of a skull, leaving a fzke one in its plafe and a grievimg family that would have been none the wiser.

Then there was the new "East AFRICAN" display room. It was almost full, but had three or four empty display cases that were awaiting some artifacts that were meant to arrive a few days earlier, but were late.

this was not something that Stan would put past Professor Tesfaye. He had never met a more committed, focused and unsociable man in his entire life.

"History is the gatekeeper of science, and it is our sacred dtuty to perserve itof generations to come." That was hix mantra and also one of his favorite andmost repeated phrases. After his first day at the Cradle (as the insidersreferred to itXX XXX XXXX StanlyX had this drummed into his head. There was justno way that he could foreXt it.
 Professor Tesfaye was in his early sixties. HX was balding, but in a bad way. He hadtwo littel patches on hair on ths idXof his head, that reminded Stan ofProfessor Calculus from the Tin Tin comics he used to read as a kid.
 Stam;ley gulped. There she was. His ex. Or nhid firlfeind. Elsie. He wasn'tquite sure which was which. She walked past his desk ontXX way X Xto her own desk,
nad acted as though StnXly wasn't there. It was super-awkward. How was Xeexpected to handle this silent treatment thing.
 "Good morning everyone. May I have your attention please.?" It was Dr. ShongXe. He was standing at the door, looking very pleased iwhthimself . His shiny head looked a little bit shinier today actually. And Xe was  Xewaring a tie. That was a sign that an important visiXXr or VIP was coming tovisit that day.The rest of the team always wondered whyhXXX he did not give themadbance notice when people were coming to visit. Rumour had it that it wasbecause he wanted to stand out from the rest of them by liooking good, whilst therest of them would just come to work as though it were any ordinary day. Not thatStanbley careX. He didn't . Nor woul dbe ever beXcaught dead in a XXX tie orjacked. But it just seemed a little bit self ish to him. That'sXall.
 "Sorry I'm late." Gugu bundled past Dr. Shonglew, who shot him a withering lookas Caiphas and the others made thier way in through the entrance on the other sideof the hall, nursing cups of coXXfee.
I was just grabbing a cup of coffee.

 "XXAre they all heare"" Dr Shonge XXXX aseke, looking at Caiphas. Caiphas XXX lookedaround theroom and nodded.
There was Gugu, XNomfau, whom hewXX was not XXyet back on speaking terms with.There was Andile, a skinny kidXwX who jad just joined the team theyXyear before.He had studeind antrhoplogy or something like that, and though that he knew itall. Then there was XXXXXChichi. She was the only white person on the team. Shewas very Afrikaans, very liberal, and very pretty. She was an archeologist andwas at the Cradle doing some reaXarch related with her masters theseis...something to do wXth arXheology and tourism and moneyizing artefacts, etc.
                                                                               Th n there was Caiphas, whom we already know about. 
"Good", saiud Dr, SginbgX, rubbing his hands in gleeful expectation Today we aregoing to have a veyX imporatn Xisitor coming past here at around midday. XIt'sthe Ambassador of Japan on an official state visit with their minister of Cultureand International CooperaXXXpn. The plan is that they will tour the facility,take photos, andthe h ave lunch at the Restaurant. So we are all to be on our XXvery best behaviour.
 "Does that mean that musXium will be closed during that time." "Only for the duration of thier visiX "No. XX XIt's a small delegation, and they did not want us closing the nmuseiu. XXTht Not that we are expecting a heck of a lot foo people today anyways. It's theoff season."
 "Anything sepecific you want me to doi, sir?" asked Caiphas, puffin g out his chestin an air oXf self importance.
"Just make sure that everything runs smoothly. Eveeryone must be in theirsectionsa XXX X at the Xppoointed time. I don't evenXwant to see this thingehwere someone shows up and the tour guide isn't around." "But sir, that's ebcause we now have the app." "People don't poay for an app. They pay for XXXXXhuman interaction." Is everyone clear?
 There was a achorus of yeses and nods from everyone on hand.
 "Good." "I will see you guys later." And he waddled out.
 "Dude, U'm so sick and tired of these state visitsXXXThey always have som manyquestions about my section." "That's the price you pay for having the coolest section, bra." "You can take it over. I'm happy to leyt go of the AX Africana section. Plusthere are some new things arriving today.  I'm praying that Xhongwewon't wantthem on display because I won't have time ti..."
 "And Gugu",.XXOne more thing. "  It was Dr. ShongeX. He stood at the entrance, XXrocking backwards and foweaeds on his heels.
"Shit, just my luck". I understand that there is a new delivery of artefacts arriving today from Nairobi for our East African Exhibition tomorrow?"
"Shit. Just my lukc." X" I understand thXt there X  is Xa new XXXX delivery of artXefacts arriving fromEast Africa today?" "Yes sir, but there is no way that I will..." 
"I want those artefacts labelled and on display by the time the VIPs get here. His Excellency is going back to Japan tomorrow and he specifically said he'd love to have a look at the East African Exhibition before he goes."
"That's what I like to see, " Tesfaye said, smiling. "Cooperation. Has the shipment arrived?

"Yes, sir. But not all of it. I estimate we've only received half of the items. There's another shipment that we are expecting to arrive this evening. It was too heavy to be flown, so they are bringing it in via ship and it will take some time to truck it up from Durban." 
"What time are we expecting the stuff to arrive."
"Tonight sir."
"So whose working overtime? That stuff has to be unpacked, tagged and put on display in time for the opening tomorrow."
"Considering that Gugu is curating that section and that collection, sir, it stands to reason that he will".
Gugu shot Caiphas a look of pure hatred. Caiphas smiled back. 







**Notes**  
"TYessir, it's been sitting outisde since eight am, waiting XXgor people to getto work but htey were late." "XXXXThere you go. Please get arond to it. We need to have those things ondisplay as soon as possible. It will look terribel for the ambarassord rot Xethere and to to go thX African section and find empty display stands.
"May be wX can take ths tands down. That would be quikcer." "Don't be silly. We are trying to impress the gentlement." He turXX X turned and waddled off again.
GuguXburied his face in his ahnds na Xa d signed.
"I was hoiping for a chilled Xay man." XXannley lay a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
"Don't worry man. I'll help you."
"Thanks man."
"April Fools!"
"Oh, come on man," Gugu said, throwing Stan's hand off his shoulder.
"No man, " Stan laughed. "Just kidding.For real, I'll help you."

'"You two had XXXXXXbtXrrety gey cracking. Its a lot of stuff to umpack." aidCaiphas said, as hXX  he walked off , chuckling and sippling his cup of coffee.
"Dick", muttered Gugu, under his breayth.
