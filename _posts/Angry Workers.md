### Angry Workers

**Synopsis**  


**Text**  
"They sent an email this morning," his sister Lerato said as he stepped into the small, pre-fabricated office at the construction site. She was only one year younger than him, and had her hair set in braids that morning. Tshepo always wondered why she wore dark power suits to work every day, even when she had to make her weekly inspection visits to the construction sites. He suspected it was to make all the men around her take her more seriously, but he never voiced his suspicions. Lerato was a feminist through and through, and getting into an argument with her was seldom worth the hurt feelings and surly looks that resulted.

Caiphas looked out the window and scoped the construction site.  Chuene Civils, had been awarded a contract to build hundreds of one and two roomed houses next to a sprawling squatter camp in the south-east of the city. The contract was worth quite a lot of money, and his father had insisted that Caiphas work closely with him and with Lerato because he intended on retiring soon, and wanted Caiphas to take over the business. Normally, Caiphas would start at the site every morning, and together with the foreman, carry out a quick progress inspection. His background in finance and accounting had given him a penchant for numbers and complicated calculations, and he often had a pragmatic approach towards the challenges they faced with the schedule, building materials and escalating costs. Caiphas suspected that the real reason Tshepo wanted him at the site was to keep a closer eye on him. Tshepo had bailed him out of the K.C.I. fiasco with quite a sizeable amount of money, and Caiphas knew that his father wanted to avoid any further issues with his eldest son. So it was with consternation that he turned back to Lerato.
"I didn't get the email. What exactly did it say?"
"I'll forward it to you, but you were copied. They said payment will only be at the end of next month. Apparently we didn't comply with some new regulation they told us about a month ago."  
Caiphas groaned. He remembered that annoying little email from the department. They always sent email after email about changes to their bureaucratic processes. For Caiphas, the only thing worse than red tape was constantly changing red tape, and after some time, he had even stopped opening the emails that would arrive from the department.
"So basically it's our fault," he muttered, sitting down at his desk and opening up his laptop.
"Yea, that's what it's looking like," Lerato responded. "What are we going to do?"
Caiphas was silent while he read and re-read the email, just to make sure. Then he leaned back in his chair, and closed his eyes. He needed to handle this situation carefully. If he did not, things could go completely out of control, and his father would become even more difficult to deal with. He still needed to stay on his father's good side. At least until he was wealthy and successful enough again to not have to rely on him for handouts. He opened his eyes again.
"I'll take care of this," he said, standing up and walking towards the door.

He spotted the foreman's pink hard hat amongst the white hard hats of the roofing team at one end of the construction site. He trudged through the muddy construction site, and pulled him aside.

"I'd like to have a word with you."
"What's up?" asked the foreman, as he followed Caiphas away from the noisy workers banging away at the roofs.

"There's been a delay in payment," Caiphas said. "Tell everyone we are having an emergency meeting in five."

Moments later, all the workers were standing in a tight huddle outside the construction site office. Caiphas stood at the topmost stair, where he could command a good view of the entire crowd. The foreman stood closest to him, right at the base of the stairs, with his distinctive pink hard hat. About a hundred surly looking construction workers , mostly in blue overalls and white hard hats, stood behind the foreman. Caiphas cleared his throat.

"I've got some bad news," he said in fluent Zulu. No one stirred. One of the workers took his hard hat off and started turning it over in his hands. Caiphas's eyes narrowed, and he continued. "There has been a slight delay with the pay this week." A collective groan rose up from the workers. Caiphas raised a hand in supplication. "But," he continued, "It will all be sorted out by Monday. I promise." 

There were murmurs and shuffling feet. A voice went up from the middle of the crowd, "That's not fair." Several more voices echoed the complaint. One of the workers stepped forward and faced the others.
"We work hard, these people don't pay us enough. Then they come here in their big cars and say that there is no money. They have stolen the money." Jeers and yells rose from the crowd. Caiphas looked at the foreman. His face was blank, his arms folded. He was not going to stick his neck out for Caiphas. He caught a movement out of the corner of his eye. Lerato had moved to the window. She was watching the proceedings quietly. The yells were getting louder and louder. Some of the workers had turned back to the construction site. They started pulling down the bricks on the nearest walls that they had just been building. 

Caiphas dashed down the steps and ran into the middle of the crowd. In moments, they closed in around him and hemmed him in. They maintained a respectful distance, but it was still clear from their movements that they only needed the slightest provocation for them to get physical. Caiphas took a deep breath. His heart was thumping wildly in his chest. He cleared his throat as he edged his way towards the men who were tearing down the wall. "Hey!" he shouted. But no one seemed to take any notice of him. He stood between the men and the wall, shielding it with his body.

"Don't be stupid," he repeated much louder this time. The crowd pressing around him paused. They realised that he was not afraid to confront them, to challenge them face to face. There was a shift in the mood, like a breeze that changes direction momentarily. Caiphas sensed it, and he grabbed his moment. 

"Guys ---," he continued. The workers noted the dropping of formalities. "Guys, have I ever let you guys down before?" Caiphas continued, doing his best to project his voice over all of their head so that they could all hear him, right to the very back of the crowd where the foreman still stood, with his pink hard hat. The crowd stirred, but no one answered. Caiphas's eyes burnt into them. He felt a rising irritation now. What he had asked was not meant to be a rhetorical question. He felt that these men were disrespecting him. They were calling his integrity into question. And yet he had provided them with jobs. He was putting food on their tables, sending their children to schools. He felt the anger within him mounting, and it was in an aggressive tone that he continued.   
"This is the first time that this has ever happened. All of these months, I have personally bent over backwards to ensure that you all get paid and that you get paid on time. When have you ever gotten your payments late?" No one responded. Caiphas's eyes swept across the grumpy faces in front of him. 
"All I am asking for is a little bit more time.  You don't know how many times I have taken a knock so that you guys don't get affected." That was a blatant lie, but he didn't care. He was reading the mood and saying whatever would work for him at that moment. 
A short worker with a high pitched voice piped up. "Stop with the stories. When are we getting paid?" A chorus of yells went up, echoing the sentiment. 
"I already told you Monday," Caiphas replied.
"Monday is too far away," shot back the short man. 
"If any of you wants to leave, you can leave now. And don't come back. Those of you who trust me, continue working and you will get paid on Monday. And this won't happen again. If you don't get paid on Monday, you can burn this place down if you want to." 

The workers were silent. Caiphas's eyes swept across the crowd in front of him,  just waiting for someone to respond. Judging from the scowl on Caiphas's face, the workers felt it best not to. Caiphas felt the balance of power shift in his favour. There was only the leader of the group to deal with now. He narrowed his gaze as he stared at the short worker with the hight-pitched voice. The man tried to hold Caiphas's gaze for a brief moment, then his eyes fell to his mud-caked construction boots. 

Caiphas pressed his advantage. He gaze them one last sweeping, half disdainful-half pained look, before pushing his way through the crowd and making his way back to the construction office.  He got to the edge of the crowd and stalked past the foreman. Lerato was waiting for him at the base of the metal stairs to the construction office.
"What happened?"
"I have till Monday to get the money."
"How are you going to do that?"
"I don't know. But," he added, pausing to look at her, "I'm not asking dad, you can be sure of that."
He stamped up the metal stairs to the construction office and banged the door shut behind him, leaving the window panes rattling.

Caiphas spent the rest of that day and the whole of the next in lengthy meetings with the managers of the three banks where Chuene Civils held bank accounts. Saturday was spent tying up some loose ends, and by Monday, they had received a line of credit and all the workers got paid. The change in mood around the site was palpable. Whereas the workers had trudged in on Monday morning looking grumpy and mutinous, by mid-morning they had picked up the pace of their work. By the end of the day, the foreman came into the office and reported that they were actually moving according to schedule for the first time in weeks.  

**Notes**  
 and opened the email that his sister had forwarded to him. He read it once, then again. Yes, Lerato was right. Due to some change in the regulations, it seemed as though the money that they had been expecting was not going to arrive. And to make matters worse, it was all their fault. His fault, to be precise.

Caiphas got on the phone and called his father, Tshepo. Tshepo was the Chairman of Molefe Construction, and their nickname for him between himself and his sister was "Merlin". Tshepo had the ability to magically sort out problems of this nature. But as he stood there in the office the next day, he was frowning.

"Do you realise how much trouble we could get into if any one of these workers went to Mshiza? Or if they staged a protest? Our next project will get pulled. And I'm telling you now that that's a big one." 
"But Mshiza won't stay in provincial housing for long," Lerato piped up, standing at the corner nursing a cup of coffee. "I saw a story today that she's about to get promoted to the cabinet."
"You think I'm not aware of that? That puts us in an even more precarious position. Dhlamini's going to take over the housing portfolio, and he and I don't have the warmest of relationships at the moment," Tshepo said, glaring at Caiphas. "The question is, who's fault is this?"

Caiphas glanced at Lerato. She seemed suddenly interested in the cup of coffee steaming in her hands. He sighed. "I got the email from Treasury some weeks ago, but I didn't think it was urgent."
"So it was your fault."
"Yes --- Yes, it is."
"So you're going to have to deal with it then?" his father snapped, a note of finality in his voice as he stood up and plucked his coat from the seat it was draped around. "I'm off to a meeting with the Mshiza. I want to find out when exactly she's leaving housing. By the time I'm back, please lets have this sorted out. Because if she or Dhalmini gets wind of this, that's the end of our business with government." He slammed the door shut behind him, and they heard his heavy steps descending the metallic steps outside the door of the pre-fabricated office. Lerato squirmed in her seat and cleared her throat. Caiphas turned to her.
"Lerato, you're the one that studied labour relations."
"So?"
"So help me out here."
"These are construction workers. They get paid weekly. What do you want me to do?"
"What must I tell them?"
"The truth I guess," she sighed. "Honesty is the best policy."


"I'm not so sure," Caiphas mumbled, going over to the window of the office and surveying the workers scattered all over the site. There must have been about a hundred of them there. If there was a demonstration, things could turn out very ugly. Caiphas gulped and turned away from the window.
"Might as well do it now then," he said, pulling the door open and walking down the stairs.
