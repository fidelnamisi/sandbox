###### WHAT DID I GET DONE THESE PAST 8 HOURS?
I made a big picture overview of all my current and upcoming writing projects. I set start and end dates for them all, and got rid of any overlaps. In the afternoon, I finished playing a game of Fiasco with Cheryl and we came up with a rather interesting story with a surprise ending.			


###### HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO MY NORMAL WORK OUTPUT?
My normal work output feels like it's gone up because now I'm focused on doing one thing for a long stretch at a time. The afternoon session was relaxing, as always.


###### DID I GET BOGGED DOWN? WHERE?
At some stage mid-morning, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of tasks I had to do after I did the work breakdown structures for each of my projects. But then I stepped away, recalibrated the task at hand by breaking it down to something really simple (set start dates for the first milestones and end dates for the last milestones per project. And that's it. No more.).


###### WHAT WENT WELL? HOW CAN I REPLICATE THIS IN THE FUTURE?
Simplify tasks. Make them as granular as possible. Makes it easier to avoid overwhelm.


###### ANY OTHER TAKEAWAYS? LESSONS TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?
I have too many "wish list" projects. I actually deleted some of them and won't give them any active attention. One of them, the one that has to do with building memory palaces, I have created a daily habit out of, since it doesn't have a tangible output and thus doesn't actually qualify as a project. I started out the exercise with 7 projects, and have whittled them down to three - two actually, and one a "wish list" project. I think having this big picture overview has made me realise where I was being unrealistic and has also helped me see how I can move one step closer to working using a solo-focus mode. I think that could be one of the biggest tricks I've discovered to finish things, then after that, to finishing things well. If I focus on one thing at a time - no matter if it takes 6 hours or 6 months - until it's done - then automatically I'll be "finishing". Simple lesson but one that I hadn't actually realised. It's possible to force the finish, but you've got to be singularly focused, which is hard.
