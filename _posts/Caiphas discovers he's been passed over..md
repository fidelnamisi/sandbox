Caiphas sat in the boardroom and flipped open his laptop. As he waited for it to connect to the Internet, he went and double checked that the doors were securely closed. Then he sat down again and opened up his video conferencing application. 
After a momentary pause, a face popped up on the computer screen.
"Chief," Caiphas said, "How are you?"
"I'm good thanks, Caiphas."
"So," Caiphas continued. "Any updates on my application?"
Kgotso cleared his throat and squirmed in his seat.
"I'm afraid that there's been a complication," he finally stammered.
"What do you mean 'there's been a complication?'"
"Er--- your application got rejected."
"Rejected? How? But I paid," Caiphas bellowed, almost rising to his feet.
"Calm down, Caiphas, calm down," Kgotso said, looking over his shoulder. "I shouldn't even be telling you this, you know."
"You should have told me that before I paid you."
"Listen, chief. It's not that simple. There were very many applicants for that position in the department, okay? People are unemployed."
"And that's why I got you on the case. What's the use of having you sitting there in the council meetings if you can't influence the decisions."
"I know, I know. And I thought that I could, but it turned out that the M.E.C. had other plans."
"What do you mean 'had other plans.'"
"It seems that his girlfriend applied for the position as well. And because he really wants her there, he told us yesterday that he was doing away with the shortlist of CVs that we sent him. It's not within my control."
"I want my money back."
"That's not going to happen," Kgotso retorted. "I've spent it already."
"I don't care. I paid you to do a job for me. You failed to do it. I want my money back. End of story."
"Please understand, chief, I didn't offer you any guarantees, remember?"
"I'm going to blow the whistle on the rot there at the department."
"Don't make me laugh," Kgotso replied. "If I go down, you go down with me. I don't know if you're thinking straight right now."
Caiphas stood up and paced up and down the lenght of the boardroom.
"Hello? Chief? Are you still there?"
"Yes, I'm here," Caiphas replied, resuming his seat. "So what do you suggest that I do now?"
"There's another position that's going to open soon. It's to be the Manager at another museum."
"I don't want to just shift musuems, Kgotso," Caiphas bellowed. "I want to move to the M.E.C's offices and start making some real money."
"Eish, then I don't know, chief. That's the best thing that I can offer you for now. Otherwise you'll just have to be patient."
"Screw patience."
"I have to go," Kgotso said, casting another hasty glance over his shoulder. "Talk soon." He shut down the connection. Caiphas pushed the chair back and gave the table leg a vicious kick. He packed up his laptop and stormed out the boardroom door, slamming it shut behind him.
