Half an hour later, he pulled up into the underground parking of his apartment complex and got out of the car, taking the jerrycan in one hand and the backpack in the other. He made his way towards the elevator, hoping that he wouldn't bump into anyone as he carried his weird cargo with him. 
The lift pulled up with a chime, and the doors open. There was an elderly white woman in the lift. They knew each other only by sight, and had never exchanged more than a few customary pleasantries.
"Afternoon," Caiphas said, stepping into the elevator.
"Hello," the old woman croaked, glancing at the twin-load that Caiphas carried. She looked away, as if being careful to mind her own business and show that she got on with everyone. 
"Nice weather we're having," Caiphas said.
"Yes, lovely," she replied. Caiphas breathed a sigh of relief as she got off on the next floor. Caiphas carried on for two more floors, got off the lift, and headed towards his loft on the top floor. As soon as he stepped in, he locked the door behind him again. He turned and looked at his apartment, taking in every detail of it in a way that he had never done before. It was almost as if he was bidding it farewell. He set the jerry-can down beside the door, and lugged the back-pack to the lounge area. He dragged the low coffee table that stood between the couches in the middle of the lounge to one side, and it's place, set the backpack down. He went over to the kitchen,  and pulled open the cupboards, looking for a box of matches. Not finding it, he eventually went on his hands and knees and opened one of the cupboards that was closer to the floor. Reaching in, he pulled out a carton containing several boxes of matches, still unwrapped. He tore off the wrapping, and grabbed a single box.

He went and sat down again on the carpet. He unscrewed the lid of the jerry-can, took a deep breathe and held it, and poured out the yellow liquid all over himself and over the obelisk. It felt warm and silky as it trickled over his skin and onto the carpet. He paused, and closed his eyes, as if steeling his will to go through with what he was about to do. He pulled the obelisk in close to him, and hugged it with one hand, wrapping both his legs around it. Then with his free hand, he pulled open the matchbox, and holding the box in the hand that was wrapped around the obelisk, he struck the match, watched the orange glow for a second, and let it fall to the ground.

There was a soft whoosh, a bright blue flame engulfed him, and he knew no more.

When he woke up, he didn't know where he was at first. He was lying flat on his soft carpet, and all around it was dark. He stirred, and knocked the obelisk as he got up. That's when it all came pouring back into his head. Mwendwa, the obelisk, the vision of the man in the tunnel, the instructions that he gave him. All of it came crashing back into his head. He got up and hurriedly crossed over to the lights, noting from the stars shimmering outside, that he must have been out cold for at least three or four hours.

He switched the lights on, expecting to see nothing but decimation. To his surprise, his apartment was absolutely spick and span. The table was right in it's place, the empty jerry can lay on it's side beside the table, and the obelisk was standing next to table, it's pointed steeple pointing at the ceiling as if nothing had even happened.

Caiphas shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts. He had definitely set himself on fire, and nothing had happened. His phone buzzed, interrupted his train of thinking. It was Lerato. He answered it.
"Hey, sis."
"Dude, I've been worried sick. Where were you? I've been trying to reach you all afternoon."
"I just passed out."
"Are you okay?"
"Yes, yes I am. I was just tired I guess."
"Ah, okay. Cool. Next time keep your phone beside you so that people don't go into a panic, okay?"
Caiphas grinned. It was so like his sister to just worry about everything, even when everything was fine. And how would he hear his phone if he was fast asleep?
"Yes, okay," he answered. "What day is it today?"
"Sunday. Are you coming in tomorrow? It's been a while since we saw you at the site."
"I don't know. I've got a meeting at the restaurant tomorrow morning. I wanted to interview a new manager."
"You're hiring a new manager?"
"Not exactly a new one. I just need someone to take over from me."
"Well, you'd better find them and find them fast, because you're not going to be that hands on at the restaurant much longer."
"Why?" Caiphas asked.
"You didn't hear this from, okay, but the board's just about to make you an offer for the CEO position."
