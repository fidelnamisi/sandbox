It has been said that we are all on different paths to climb up the same mountain, and we will all get to the same peak where we will find the same God. The path may be called Buddha or Yahweh or Mohammed or Christ. But they all lead to the same God.

But mountain paths sometimes  lead to ravines and precipices. Often, the more challenging the summit, the fewer sure paths there are to the top. And eternal life is the most difficult peak in the universe. The only one that claimed to be the way itself and the summit itself said as much.

"Take the straight and narrow path, for the road to perdition is wide and many take it."
