Okay so this is a test to see whether or not if I add like 31 more words, my Beeminder.com daily target is going to drop to 100 words.

This thing of actually changing the filename extension over and over again is actually a bit of a schlep. But it's fine I'll deal with it. It's a step less - actually several steps less - than the hassle that I used to face with Github and Cloudlfare pages, which by the way I have to change and update tomorrow. But for now I'm going to go downstairs for dinner.

Will this update the same post or create a new one?

Erue woke up that morning with a sense of foreboding in his tummy. He went about his usual chores that he would normally get through after waking up. Erue lived in the village of Mapungu, on the eastern edge of the Kongo empire, right beside the Kongo river, that fomred a natural border between his people, the last-remaining clan of the once great Sa people, and their conquerers, the Kongo.

You see, Erue truly, madly and deeply hated the fact that he had to collect taxes and tributes from his own people on behalf of the King of the Kongo, King Mwenda. Mwenda ruled from the city of Mpembe, near the heart of the empire, from where he would send out his fighting force, the fierce Vinyamkera, and subjugate and subdue all the neighbouring people. The Sa people, being the first nation beside teh young upstart Kongo who had organized his loose collecton of unruly and untrained fighters, disciplined and trained them, and with promises of wealth untold had ser out raiding neighbouring villages, burning them to the ground, loothing heir cattle and capturing slaves, then exacting vengeatnce and control via a heavy toll. It irked Erhue that hispeople had been teh first to fall - that his people had been the weakest. And after the first few nations had been subjugated, the rest qualied in fear and submitted. As a result, Mwenda's son, Pandemu and his grandson, Mwenda the second or Mwenda wa Pandemu, both had led less warlike lives, and actually enjoyed rather luxurious lives.

Erue was not looking forward at all to the harvest celebratiaon that would be held a the home of his prosperuos half-brother and cousin, Okosi. Okosi was oth his half-brother and cousin because Erue's father, Korua, had married two sisters amongst his harem of six. Thus amongst his seventeen siblings, thre were four who were both his half-siblings and his cousins, being the children of his mother's sister, Adimpo. Okosi was the most prosperous of all of them. He had made his fortune from organizing labourers and slaves for the caravans of the Arabs. One in particular, named Tippu, had made Okosi rich. Every time when Okosi would be gone for a long period of time, everyone knew that he would return with a sack of cowrie shells, offer them to the poor, lounging cowherders who dreamed of adventure, and promised them wealth beyond their wildest drams. Scores of them would set out with him. About half of them would not return. The others who did would come back cowrie-shells, about enough to purchase several heads of cows from thier neighbouring clans (purchasing cows within the same clan was not allowed), and then be able to start their own families. For many, one trip was enough. But for some of them - those who had that far-away dreamy look in their eyes - they would sit queitly and brood, eyes scanning the horizon, thoughts and dreams elsewehere - as they waited for the very next opportunity to get onto an expedition and go off on more adventures.

2022-08-01

Many of Erue's cousins had made their fortunes in this way. For them, this was the right and proper way to make money: high adventures in the high jungles - not by slaving away for the corrupt establishment. So it was with an aching heart and a drooping head that Erue accepted Okosi's invitation to attend the harvest dance. He knew that all of his family would be there, and once again they would turn to the usual topics of conversation: when the next expedition would be, who would go, how much money they all stood to make from that simple trip, and, as always, Erue would be treated respectfully, yes, but with that cold officiousness that is reserved usually for estranged family members.

"Of course you are,"his first and eldest wife, Njiomi, replied when he told her that was feeling unwell and not looking forward to the ceremony. "But,"she added, "just remember what happened two years ago when you felt unwell for the harvest celebration at Miano's? I spent the whole day and evening listening to people speaking ill about you. So if you're not going to go, then neither am I."
"What that about not going?"Nyami, his second, younger wife asked, entering the hut with a pot of water deftly balanced on her head. "Don't tell me that you're not going to the party, husband."
"He says he's feeling unwell," Njiomi replied. 
"Oh, okay."
Erue caught the slightest hint of a ghost of a smile in her eyes as she turned away, her heavy figure waddling away. She was heavy with child, and the baby was expected by the next short rains season, within three moons. He knew that she wanted him to remain at the homestead so she could have a little bit of company, which, in his mind, meant having him all to herself so she could harass and harange him with her every little demand and her endless incessant conversation. He was not going to uput up with that ata all, not if he could avoid it. He made up his mind right there and then.
"You know what," he said. "You're right. And I don't go, they're going to think that I am being deliberately disrespectful. And that will not help my reputation much. I have made up my mind. I will go. Please catch two hens outside and tie them up so that I can take them with me.

And here is where I would include a detailed description of the village or hamlet in which Erue lives. The name of the village is Ampere - the turtle shell. It was named thus because it’s nestled in a hill, at the very top of which is a round, smooth weathered rock. Erue wound his way through the low mud walls thay formed a labyrinthine streets of the village, taking good care to avoud the homestead of the chief - a rotund, balding and wholly irritating man named Shaosi. He did not want to be spotted with the hends in his possession and be subjected to a line of questioning about catching the tax dodgers when he got to the party - and so as you can imagine, dear reader - that is precisely what happened. But I will spare you the details in the interest of time, ink and my carpal-tunnely syndromed wrist, and proceed straight on to the meat and potatoes of the encounter, or in this particular case, perhaps we should say the chicken and the yams of it.

When Erue arrived at his brother Okoisi’s homestead, he could already hear the drums beating and rythmic stomping of feet, accompanied by shrieks of delight and harmonious singing. He was glad that he was late. If there were many people there alreaedy, it was mean that the drinking of honey-beer would already be underway, and so the chances of Okoisi taking any notice of him and striking up the usual awkward 

awkward conversation would be reduced. He was sorely mistaken.

As he walked past the cattle enclosure that nestled outside Okoisi’s homestead, he could smell the roast goatmeat and the sorghum being cooked in the kitchen huts close by. Okoisi, his sons Wanesi, Oba and Kitilu, were dragging a goat out of the cattle enclosure. Okoisi stood by and watched with a frown on his face whilst his three sons struggled with the bleating, resistant beast. It was as though the animal sensed their intentions, and was putting up quite a fight. Erue would have walked straight past, hugging the far edge of the beaten footpath, but Okoisi spotten him.
“Brother, you are late.”
“Am I? I got delated by the chief. He wanted to discuss some important matters with me.”

He follows Okoisi into the middle of the homestead. Already there were some young girls dancing, in preparation for the main dance which would take place as the sun was setting and everyone was fairly full. - Warming up the musicians - the most prominent of them all - Miano with his four sons - drummers whose skuill was spoken of even in the ears of the King at his court in Zvongombe - Okoisi wants Erue to sit down with the other men - Kazanada, Anua, Bango and Miano - tense silence - Erue knows these men hate his guts - tense conversation about the weather and when it turn to crops - one man quips that they shouldn’s speak about crops in Erue’s presence - he says he won’t do it. He refuses to speak.

The healer arrives…describe his garb - beads around his waist - bangles of sheepskin sourced from the animals sacrificed during his initiation - a collection of small gourds ratthling around his neck - suspended from leather thongs - skin glistening in the sun - had oiled himself for the occasion. “Have you selected the sindo, the goat to be sacrificed to the ancestors? - Not yet - Dambe. Dambe went by many titles, the main one bing Kivoo - the caller of spirits - then let us go and select it.
All the men stood up and walked out. No, just Erue and Okoisi. It was customary for the host and his immediate younger brother do the deed of slaughtering the goat. - They find the goat - brown with white spots - and proceed to catch it, tie its legs and lay it on its side - Dambe gives Erue a knife and tell him to nick it in the throat - the idea is to call the ancestors to preside over the gathering via the bleating of the goat, which will summon them. The goat’s sharp cries are meant to wake the ancestors from their slumber - lo and behold - the goat does not cry. Not even once. Erue’s eyes widen in shock. Dambe and Okoisi’s are shocked into silnece. Okoisi asks whether he himself can do it. He grabs the knife and slits the goat’s throat - the goat immediately bleats plaintively. Erue turns and walks away.

Later the celebrations are underway, and the young women are dancing to the lyre and the drums - Erue sits all alone - watching. He regrets having attended the ceremony. He can see from the furtive glances that the married women are throwing his way from the edge of the gathering where they are seated, nestling the young ones, that they are speaking about him.

Erue got up and went across to the group of men seated around the big, brown beer pot, all with long hollow reeds sticking into it, which they sipped from as they chatted away animatedly. They all fall into silence as Erue approached. He grreeted them. Soome of them nodded sullenly. Others simply stared back at him, offering ho response. Still others ignored him completely, and turned their eyes to the beer pot, staring intently at it. Erue asked if he could join them. Th eldedst of the group, a man completely bald and with scraggy tufts of white hair dotting his neck, cheeks and chin, shook his head and told Erue that they didn’t have an extra reed for him. Erue pointed to the reed that lay on the ground nearby - emmeingly the last of the poile that they young woman serving them had brought. The man pretended not to have seen. Erue picked it up, stuck one end inside the pot, and proceeded to sip from it. One by one, the men stood up and walked way. Some spat on the ground in disgust, muttering imprecations. Soon only Erue and the balding old man were left.
“You should not have come here,”the man said. “You have ruined what was a good party.”
“My brother invited me.”
“Out of courtesy, But that doesn’t mean that he expected you to come!”
The man stood up and also walked way, leaving Erue staring intently at the beer pot.

Why am I, as Erces so deeply motivated to help thisslalt run away from his owners. I can see that hehas tremendous magical abilities - namely - he canactually manipulate what people are sering - buta power like that, whilst it can make me a lot ofmoney, is something that can cause a lot of harm andamage in the world. But if I protect him, and granthim what he wishes - namely - safe conduct to themiddle of the island ofin the Grey swamps, wherhe can find the plant that will make him forgeteverything he ever did - I mean - I would not onlylose out, but it will also mean that I too forget,because for the spell to work, for the flower to work,the person must be holding the hand of someone elsewho is also willing to forget.Alternatively, it could be the realization thatPitui will kill wheever attempts to take this child outof his hands, which is what I see when he murdersthe people who try to kindap Adera. It's what he saysmore than anything else = "" I have worked too hardand too long to let anyone or anything stand in my way.Because we were hired to track and trace this Mungialslave-girl named Adera, who brought her employersa lot of money with her "circus tricks." She's 9 yearold, cute and innocent. No, she's 16 and rebelliousand problematic. Whoever is near her must wear acharm to protect or shield themselves from herinfluence.So I start cut believing that we should returnthe girl, but as time passes, I start to believe thatI can make a difference in her life.

But then all of a sudden, fertune puts thislittle girl in my path, and she forees me toquestion my beliet, that I am not a good father.She makes me see what it means to be a goodfather. - makes me believe that I can be. Thequestion is:So I start out believing that it doesn't matter, solong as it makes me money, right. But am I willing tostand by this belicy, no matter what.? Is money, the mostimportant thing in life? It's like all my life I have chasedgold and lowrie shells and wealth, and now I and facedwith the kind of person that it has made me become.Am I happier ? Am I fulfilled.? Could this girl, and doingright by her, be the only thing that brings some level efjoy and fulfilment to my life?This is the question that reps through my mindhal way through the story, 4 chasing money and wealthwill lead one to become a heartless man like Tipui, withno family, no real friends and nekedy that he caresabout or worse still, no body that cares about hiovy, inthat really the kind of person I myself am ? Is that thekind of person I myself am becoming, little by little?So it seems to me as if I will start out placing theMission - which is retimering the runaway slave girl andreturning her to her owners, about everything else onthe mission And because I am a loyal henchman type ofperson, there is no way in which...
