**About Me**

Ah, greetings from the quirky side of Pretoria, where the sidewalks are so broad they double as fashion runways for the Indian mynas and the trees are like the VIP section at a tree concert. Yep, that's my hood, where the flora and fauna know my name (well, in my imagination, at least).

So, picture this: every morning, while the world is still deciding whether it's time to hit the snooze button or not, I'm out there, strutting the streets like I'm in a morning parade. Why, you ask? Well, my body clock is like a drill sergeant with a megaphone at 5:10 am, screaming, "Rise and shine, sleepyhead!"

Now, let's talk exercise. I have this solo workout routine that's as rebellious as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. I never feel like doing it, but once I start, it's like my body goes, "Hey, thanks for not letting us turn into human marshmallows!"

And bedtime, oh boy! I'm a rebel reader, risking my sleep for the thrill of an awesome book. It's like a literary rollercoaster – dangerous, thrilling, and occasionally involves yelling at the characters to get their act together.

Let's get a bit psychological, shall we? I'm an INFJ (think rare unicorn) with a sprinkle of Enneagram type 4 – because why be mainstream when you can be a walking paradox? Melancholic-choleric, because my emotions are like a dramatic opera with occasional bursts of fiery enthusiasm.

Love languages? Oh, I speak "quality time" fluently, and "words of affirmation" is my side hustle. If you ever need a compliment, just hit me up – I'm your linguistic cheerleader.

Nature is my therapy, and deep one-on-one conversations are my jam. Imagine me in the woods, having a profound discussion with a wise owl. Yeah, that's pretty much my happy place.

So, there you have it – my life in Pretoria, where every day is an adventure, and every tree has a story to tell.
